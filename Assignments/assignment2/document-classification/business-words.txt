can improve this year and next worries about the deficit concerns about china do however remain chinas currency remains pegged to the dollar and the us currencys sharp falls in recent months have therefore made chinese export prices highly competitive but calls for a shift in beijings policy have fallen on deaf ears despite recent comments in a major chinese newspaper that the time is ripe for a loosening of the peg the g meeting is thought unlikely to produce any meaningful movement in chinese policy in the meantime the us federal reserves decision on february to boost interest rates by a quarter of a point the sixth such move in as many months has opened up a differential with european rates the halfpoint window some believe could be enough to keep us assets looking more attractive and could help prop up the dollar the recent falls have partly been the result of big budget deficits as well as the uss yawning current account gap both of which need to be funded by the buying of us bonds and assets by foreign firms and governments the white house will announce its budget on monday and many commentators believe the deficit will remain at close to half a trillion dollars yukos

in the three months to september figures show revised figures indicated growth of just and a similarsized contraction in the previous quarter on an annual basis the data suggests annual growth of just suggesting a much more hesitant recovery than had previously been thought a common technical definition of a recession is two successive quarters of negative growth the government was keen to play down the worrying implications of the data i maintain the view that japans economy remains in a minor adjustment phase in an upward climb and we will monitor developments carefully said economy minister heizo takenaka but in the face of the strengthening yen making exports less competitive and indications of weakening economic conditions ahead observers were less sanguine its painting a picture of a recovery much patchier than previously thought said paul sheard economist at lehman brothers in tokyo improvements in the job market apparently have yet to feed through to domestic demand with private consumption up just in the third quarter jobs growth still slow in the us the us created fewer jobs than expected in january but a fall in jobseekers pushed the unemployment rate to its lowest level in three years according to labor department figures us firms added only jobs in january the gain in nonfarm payrolls was below market expectations of new jobs nevertheless it was enough to push down the unemployment rate to its lowest level since september the job gains mean that president bush can celebrate albeit by a very fine margin a net growth in jobs in the us economy in his first term in office he presided over a net fall in jobs up to last novembers presidential election the first president to do so since herbert hoover as a result job creation became a key issue in last years election however when adding december and januarys figures the administrations first term jobs record ended in positive territory the labor department also said it had revised down the jobs gains in december from to analysts said the growth in new jobs was not as strong as could be expected given the favourable economic conditions it suggests that employment is continuing to expand at a moderate pace said rick egelton deputy chief economist at bmo financial group we are not getting the boost to employment that we would have got given the low value of the dollar and the still relatively low interest rate environment the economy is producing a moderate but not a satisfying amount of job growth said ken mayland president of clearview economics that means there are a limited

developing nations like india to compete he also called for reform of the united nations the world bank and the imf palaniappan chidambaram indias finance minister argued that these organisations need to take into account the changing world order given india and chinas integration into the global economy he said the issue is not globalisation but the terms of engagement in globalisation mr chidambaram is attending the g meeting as part of the g group of nations which account for two thirds of the worlds population at a conference on developing enterprise hosted by uk finance minister

positive and negative shocks he told the conference india along with china brazil south africa and russia has been invited to take part in the g meeting taking place in london on friday and saturday china is expected to face renewed pressure to abandon its fixed exchange rate which g nations in particular the us have blamed for a surge in cheap chinese exports some countries have tried to use

heavily subsidised for years president susilo bambang yudhoyonos government has said it wants to curb fuel subsidies and direct the money into aid programmes for the poor but critics argue cutting subsidies will hurt the poorer families that his government says it wants to help millions of people were left homeless in indonesia acehs region following the earthquake and tsunami disaster in late december indonesia pays subsidies to importers in order to stabilise domestic fuel prices but higher oil prices have forced the government to spend more on holding prices down it spent trillion rupiah bn bn on fuel subsidies in a sum far in excess of its original projection of trillion rupiah since president yudhoyonos government came to power in october it has indicated its intention of raising domestic fuel prices by cutting subsidies the january to march quarter of this year is the best time for us to increase fuel prices said sri mulyani indrawati state minister for national development planning we are still considering if a hike is suitable at the moment the sooner the better for the state budget the bbcs correspondent in jakarta rachel harvey told world business report that there

competition from online advertising the national union of journalists has called on the management to recall the notice of redundancy by midday on monday or face a strike ballot pearsons financial times said last week it was offering voluntary redundancy to about reporters the national union of journalists said it stood strongly behind the journalists and did not rule out a strike managers have torn up agreed procedures and kicked staff in the teeth by sacking people to pay for printing facilities said jeremy dear nuj general secretary nuj official barry fitzpatrick said the company had ignored the day consultation period required for companies planning more than redundancies they have shown a complete disregard for the consultative rights of our members said mr fitzpatrick who added that the company now planned to observe the consultation procedures the two telegraph titles currently employ journalists some broadsheet newspapers especially those which have not moved to a tabloid format have suffered circulation declines which are hitting revenues the telegraph has announced no plans to go tabloid although both the independent and the times have seen circulation rise since

sunday telegraph for our readers is vital he said however action to improve our production capability and secure our titles against the competition is also vital many newspapers are investing in new

into state media report the curbs were introduced earlier this year to ward off the risk that rapid expansion might lead to soaring prices there were also fears that too much stress might be placed on the fragile banking system growth in china remains at a breakneck and corporate investment is growing at more than a year the breakneck pace of economic expansion has kept growth above for more than a year rapid toolingup of chinas manufacturing sector means a massive demand for energy one of the factors which has kept world oil prices skyhigh for most of this year in theory the government has a growth target but continues to insist that the overshoot does not mean a hard landing in the shape of an overbalancing economy a low exchange rate chinas yuan is pegged to a rate of to the dollar which seems to be in relentless decline means chinese exports are cheap on world markets china has thus far resisted international pressure to break the link or at least to shift the level of its peg

group call centre users lose patience customers trying to get through to call centres are getting impatient and quicker to hang up a survey suggests once past the welcome message callers on average hang up after just seconds of listening to canned music the drop in patience comes as the number of calls to call centres is growing at a rate of every year customers are getting used to the idea of an always available society says cara diemont of it firm dimension data which commissioned the survey however call centres also saw a sharp increase of customers simply abandoning calls she says from just over in to a record during last year when automated phone message systems are taken out of the equation where customers have to pick their way through multiple options and messages the number of abandoned calls is even higher a sixth of all callers give up rather than wait one possible reason for the lack in patience ms diemont says is the fact that more customers are calling on the move using their mobile phones the surge in customers trying to get through to call centres is also a reflection of the centres growing range of tasks once a call centre may have looked after mortgages now its agents may also be responsible for credit cards insurance and current accounts ms diemont says problems are occurring because increased responsibility is not going handinhand with more training the survey found in what dimension data calls an alarming development the average induction time for a call centre worker fell last year from to just days leaving agents not equipped to deal with customers this ms diemont warns is scary and not good for the bottom line either poor training frustrates both call centre workers and customers as a result call centres have a high churn rate with nearly a quarter of workers throwing in the towel every year which in turn forces companies to pay for training new staff resolution rates the number of calls where a customers query is resolved to mutual satisfaction are running at just when the query is passed on to a second or third person a specialist or manager rates rise to about but that is still well below the industry target of an resolution rate suggestions that outsourcing relocating call centres to lowcost countries like india or south africa is to blame are wrong ms diemont says there are no big differences in wait time and call resolution between call centres based in europe or north america and those in developing countries around the world you can make call centres perform anywhere if you have good management and the right processes in place she says however companies that decide to offshore their operations are driven not just by cost considerations only of them say that saving money is the main consideration when closing domestic call centre operations half of them argue that workers in other countries offer better skills for the money but not everybody believes that outsourcing and offshoring are the solution nearly twothirds of all firms polled for the survey have no plans to offshore their call centres they give three key reasons for not making the move call centre operations are part of their business core function they are worried about the risk of going abroad they fear that they will damage their brand if they join the offshoring drive the survey was conducted by sunovate on behalf of dimension data and is based on indepth questionnaires of call centres in countries and five continents what are your experiences with call centres are you happy to listen to vivaldi or greensleeves or do you want an immediate response and if you work in a call centre did your training prepare you for your job sluggish economy hits german jobs the number of people out of work in europes largest economy has risen for the tenth straight month as growth remains stubbornly slow german unemployment rose in november to million people or of the workforce the seasonally adjusted rise showed a smaller rise than expected as government measures to encourage job creation began to take effect but officials said stagnant growth was still stifling the job market there are clear signs of a revival in domestic demand said frankjuergen weise head of the federal labour agency in a statement but growth of in the third quarter is still insufficient to deliver positive momentum to the labour market high oil prices and the soaring euro which damages the competitiveness of exporters were also having a negative effect he said the brunt of the unemployment is still being felt in the eastern part of germany where the rate is with unemployment stuck above million for years the government of chancellor gerhard schroeder has put job creation at the top of the agenda a controversial package of measures to shake up incentives to get back to work paid for by cutting some cherished benefits has sparked anger among some german workers strikes in a number of industries notably among the countrys iconic carmakers have demonstrated the displeasure as well as fears about further job losses as outsourcing takes hold among the new initiatives are the socalled oneeuro jobs which top up unemployment benefit the schemes formal launch is january but hirings for these positions are already taking place and affecting the unemployment statistics economists said the deterioration of the labour market does not come as a surprise said isabelle kronawitter at hypovereinsbank job creation measures probably prevented a stronger increase in the seasonally adjusted numbers us trade gap hits record in the gap between us exports and imports hit an alltime high of bn bn in latest figures show the commerce department said the trade deficit for all of last year was above the previous record s imbalance of bn the deficit with china up at bn was the largest ever recorded with a single country however on a monthly basis the us trade gap narrowed by in december to bn the us consumers appetite for all things from oil to imported cars and even wine and cheese reached record levels last year and the figures are likely to spark fresh criticism of president bushs economic policies democrats claim the administration has not done enough to clamp down on unfair foreign trade practices for example they believe chinas currency policy which us manufacturers claim has undervalued the yuan by as much as has given chinas rapidly expanding economy an unfair advantage against us competitors meanwhile the bush administration argues that the us deficit reflects the fact the america is growing at faster rate than the rest of the world spurring on more demand for imported goods some economists say this may allow an upward revision of us economic growth in the fourth quarter but others point out that the deficit has reached such astronomical proportions that foreigners many choose not to hold as many dollardenominated assets which may in turn harm growth for all of us exports rose to trillion but imports rose even faster by to a new record of trillion foreign oil exports surged by to a record bn reflecting the rally in global oil prices and increasing domestic demand imports were not affected by the dollars weakness last year we expect the deficit to continue to widen in even if the dollar gets back to its downward trend said economist mariepierre ripert at ixis safety alert as gm recalls cars the worlds biggest carmaker general motors gm is recalling nearly vehicles in the us on safety grounds according to federal regulators the national highway traffic safety administration nhtsa said the largest recall involves pickups vans and sports utility vehicles suvs this is because of possible malfunctions with the braking systems the affected vehicles in the product recall are from the and model years gm said those vehicles with potential faults are the chevrolet avalanche express kodiak silverade and suburban the gmc savana sierra and yukon the nhtsa said a pressure accumulator in the braking system could crack during normal driving and fragments could injure people if the hood was open this could allow hydraulic fluid to leak which could make it harder to brake or steer and could cause a crash it warned gm is also recalling cadillac xlr coupes srx suvs and pontiac grand prix sedans from the model year this is because the accelerator pedal may not work properly in extremely cold temperatures requiring more braking in addition the car giant is calling back buick raniers chevrolet trailblazers gmc envoys and isuzu ascenders from the model years because the windshield is not properly fitted and could fall out in a crash however gm stressed that it did not know of any injuries related to the problems news of the recall follows an announcement last month

on friday that farmland owned by a subsidiary of the vestey group would be taken and used to settle poor farmers the government is cracking down on socalled latifundios or large rural estates which it says are lying idle the vestey group said it had not been informed of any planned seizure the firm whose agroflora subsidiary operates farms in venezuela insisted that it had complied fully with venezuelan law prosecutors in the south of the country have targeted hato el charcote a beef cattle ranch owned by agroflora according to reuters they plan to seize acres hectares from the acre hectare farm officials claim that agroflora does not possess valid documents proving its ownership of the land in question they also allege that areas of the ranch are not being used for any form of active production the legal boundaries did not match up with the actual boundaries and there is surplus state prosecutor alexis ortiz told reuters as a consequence the government has taken action controversial reforms passed in give the government the right to take control of private property if it is declared idle or ownership cannot be traced back to the th century critics say the powers which president chavez argues are needed to help the countrys poorest citizens and develop the venezuelan economy trample all over private property rights the vestey group said it had owned the land since and would cooperate fully with the authorities but a spokesman added agroflora is absolutely confident that what it has submitted will demonstrate the legality of its title to the land the company pointed out that the farm which employs workers provides meat solely for the venezuelan market last month the government said it had identified more than idle farms and had yet to consider the status of a further the authorities said landowners whose titles were in order and whose farms were productive had nothing to fear under president chavez the venezuelan government has steadily expanded the states involvement in the countrys economy it recently said all mining contracts involving foreign firms would be examined to ensure they provided sufficient economic benefits to the

biannual report the oecd cut its growth predictions for the worlds main industrialised regions us growth would reach in but fall to next year from a previous estimate of the oecd said however the

worst for the member eurozone bloc with already sluggish growth forecasts slipping to from this year and from in the oecd said overall the report forecast total growth of in for the member countries of the oecd slipping to next year before recovering to in there are nonetheless good reasons to believe that despite recent oil price turbulence the world economy will regain momentum in a nottoodistant future said jeanphilippe cotis the oecds chief economist the price of crude is about higher than it was at the start of but down on the record high of set in late october a dip in oil prices and improving jobs prospects would improve consumer confidence and spending the oecd said the oil shock is not enormous by historical standards we have seen worse in the seventies if the oil price does not rise any further then we think the shock can be absorbed within the next few quarters vincent koen a senior economist with the oecd told the bbcs world business report the recovery that was underway and has been interrupted a bit by the oil shock this year would then regain momentum in the course of chinas booming economy and a spectacular comeback in japan albeit one that has faltered in recent months would help world economic recovery the oecd said supported by strong balance sheets and high profits the recovery of business investment should continue in north america and

trade fed chief warning on us deficit federal reserve chairman alan greenspan has warned that allowing huge us budget deficits to continue could have severe consequences speaking to the house budget committee he urged congress to take action to cut the deficit such as increasing taxes while the us economy is growing at a reasonably good pace he warned that budget concerns were clouding the economic outlook for the us pension and healthcare costs posed the greatest risks to the economy he said the government program faces severe financial strains in coming decades as the massive babyboom generation retires i fear that we may have already committed more physical resources to the babyboom generation in its retirement years than our economy has the capacity to deliver if existing promises need to be changed those changes should be made sooner rather than later mr greenspan said he also warned that unless the nation sees unprecedented rises in productivity retirement and health programmes would need significant changes he called on congress to cut promised benefits for retirees as the promised benefits for the soontoretire baby boom generation were much larger than the government could afford meanwhile any move to narrow the deficit gap by raising taxes could pose a significant risk to the economy by dampening growth and spending he added he also urged congress to reinstate lapsed rules that require tax cuts and spending to be offset elsewhere in the budget in an effort to prevent the us heading further into the red despite the dire warnings mr greenspan did offer some good news for the short term as us growth gathers steam and incomes rise that should lead to a narrowing of the deficit recent increases in defence and homeland security spending were also not expected to continue indefinitely which should cut some costs since president george w bush came to office the federal budget has swung from a record surplus to a record deficit of bn last year uk

cowley factory on the outskirts of oxford but the target was quickly reached then raised time and time again not everyone is convinced that the boom can continue the risk is that after theyve invested

good much of what went wrong during its stewardship of the uk car maker rover which it sold for five years ago to the phoenix consortium in when bmw still owned rover the oxford factory was producing the awardwinning rover during that year people produced cars last year in the same factory almost four times as many vehicles were produced by just miniworkers the mini factorys current output is equally impressive when compared with the main rover factory in longbridge which in produced rover cars last year mg rover which employs more than people produced just cars though it hopes to land a deal with shanghai automotive industry corporation saic that could help double the number of cars produced at longbridge indeed mini is not only producing more cars than mg rover does it remains ahead

brightest talents analysts say that hiring and firing staff is still too difficult and expensive hampering the development of small and mediumsized businesses as a result they say italys corporate landscape is filled with numerous smaller companies that are often reluctant to become bigger because of all the extra hassle that would accompany the running of a larger firm at the same time bankruptcy laws make it difficult for failed company directors to set up new businesses and emerge from their debts a situation that is hampering italys entrepreneurial spirit the government says that it has set about tackling the problems adding that getting growth going was the responsibility of all of italys million population according to il sole ore italys business newspaper the government

collectively show a rapid slowdown in uk house price growth she pointed out this means that despite a strong economic growth base rates will probably stay on hold at official data comes from the office for national statistics ons though reliable ons data takes longer to publish so now the boe is calling for faster delivery of data so it can make more effective policy decisions recent work by the bank has shown that private sector surveys add value even when preliminary ons estimates are available ms lomax said in a speech to the north wales business club the ons is due to publish its second estimate of third quarter growth on friday the mpc judges that overall growth was a little higher in the third quarter than the official data currently indicate ms lomax said the bank said successful monetary policy depends on having good information rachel lomax cited the late s as an example of a time when weak economic figures were published but substantially revised upwards years later the statistical fog surrounding the true state of the economy has proved a particularly potent breeding ground for policy errors in the past she said improving the quality of national statistics is the single the best way of making sure the monetary policy committee mpc makes the right decisions she said the bank of england is working in tandem with the ons to improve the quality and speed of delivery of data her remarks follow criticism from the house of lords economic affairs committee which said the mpc had held interest rates too high given that inflation was way below the target a slowdown in the housing market and this years surge in oil prices has made economic forecasting all the more tricky leading to a more uncertain outlook this year rising oil prices and a significant slowdown in the housing market have awoken bad memories of the s and s ms lomax said the mpc will be doing well if it can achieve the same stability over the next decade as we have enjoyed over the past years decisions on interest rates are made after the mpc gathers together the range of indicators available every month the clearest signals come when all indicators are pointing the same

december up from novembers the office for national statistics ons added meanwhile the benefit claimant total fell to last month throughout the number of people in work increased by to million the

airport we are doing research into the possibilities we have michael lamberty a lufthansa spokesman told the bbc we are checking if there is action to be taken and in which courts it could be taken mr lamberty explained that the company did not plan to pursue germanys air traffic controllers organisation or the airport authority but wanted instead to see if it was possible to sue the german federal agencies that gave the orders the company said that it had to cancel short and mediumdistance flights affecting about passengers longhaul travellers were not disrupted central to the problem was that instead of half an hour the arrival of president bush on the german leg of his european tour took the best part of an hour lufthansa said during that time restrictions were put on planes taxiing taking off and landing at frankfurts rheinmain airport the extra time taken by president bush and his entourage meant that there was a knockon effect that led to significant delays mr lamberty said

sectors had worsened observers had been hoping that a more confident business sector would signal that economic activity was picking up were surprised that the ifo index has taken such a knock said dz bank economist bernd weidensteiner the main reason is probably that the domestic economy is still weak particularly in the retail trade economy and labour minister wolfgang clement called the dip in februarys ifo confidence figure a very mild decline he said that despite the retreat the index remained at a relatively high level and that he expected a modest economic upswing to continue germanys economy grew last year after shrinking in however the economy contracted by during the last three months of mainly due to the reluctance of consumers to spend latest indications are that growth is still proving elusive and ifo president hanswerner sinn said any improvement in german domestic demand was sluggish exports had kept things going during the first half of but demand for exports was

to boost construction india has cleared a proposal allowing up to foreign direct investment in its construction sector kamal nath commerce and industry minister announced the decision in delhi on thursday following a cabinet meeting analysts say improving indias infrastructure will boost foreign investment in other sectors too the indian governments decision has spread good cheer in the construction sector according to some indian firms a spokesman for dlf builders dr vancheshwar told the bbc this will mean better offerings for consumers as well as builders he said the firm will benefit from world class strategic partnerships design expertise and technology while consumers will have better choice the government proposal states that foreign investment of up to will be allowed on the automatic route in the construction sector on projects including housing hotels resorts hospitals and educational establishments the automatic route means that construction companies need only get one set of official approvals and do not need to gain clearance from the foreign investment promotion board which can be bureaucratic the government hopes its new policy will create employment for construction workers and benefit steel and brickmaking industries mr nath also announced plans to allow foreign investors to develop a smaller area of any land they acquired foreign investors can enter any construction development area be it to build resorts townships or commercial premises but they will have to construct at least square meters square feet within a specific timeframe said mr nath without specifying the timeframe previously foreign investors had to develop a much larger area discouraging some from entering the indian market this measure is designed to discourage foreign investors from buying and selling land speculatively without developing it anshuman magazine managing director of cb richard ellis an international real estate company told the bbc this was a big positive step however chittabrata majumdar general secretary of the centre of indian trade unions citu said allowing fdi in the country is compromising indias own self reliance he said no country can develop on the basis of foreign investment alone mr majumdar also said an assessment should be made as to whether foreign investment is indeed beneficial to the country in terms of employment and

regain its position as the industrys leading manufacturer the lr will be capable of flying almost miles nonstop linking cities such as london and sydney boeing in contrast to european rival airbus hopes airlines will want to fly smaller aircraft over longer distances airbus which overtook boeing as the number one civilian planemaker in is focusing on socalled super jumbos analysts are divided over which approach is best and say that this latest tussle between boeing and airbus may prove to be a defining moment for the airline industry boeing plans to offer twinengine planes that are able to fly direct to many of the worlds airports getting rid of the need for connecting flights it is banking on smaller slimmer planes such as the lr and its muchanticipated dreamliner plane which is set to take to the skies in the lr which had its launch delayed by the september attacks in the us is the fifth variation of boeings twinaisle plane the company offically rolledout the new in seattle at gmt better fuel efficiency from engines made by ge and lighter materials mean that the plane can connect almost any two cities worldwide boeing has the latest variant in a very successful line of airplanes and there is no doubt it will continue to be very successful said david learmount operations and safety editor at industry magazine flight international but the lr is a niche player mr learmount continued adding that reach was not the only criteria airlines used when picking their aircraft mr learmount pointed out that the lr has been on the market for a couple of years and only had limited success at attracting orders he also said that while the plane may be able to fly to sydney from london in one hit prevailing winds meant that it would have to stop somewhere on the return journey for airbus the future is big it is pinning its hopes on planes that can carry as many as people between large hub airports from there passengers would be ferried to their final destinations by

alternatives japanese brewers are increasingly making money from beerflavoured drinks rather than beer itself beer and spirits are heavily taxed in japan driving breweries to search for alternatives japans long economic downturn helped drive the trend as drinkers looked for cheaper opportunities to drown their sorrows now according to asahi breweries the market for socalled beerlike drinks is set to grow this year asahi is predicting profits to rise in as it launches a drink based on soybean peptides rather than malt the chosen name shinnama or new draft disguises its nonbeer nature but despite a record profit in of bn yen m m up on the previous year asahi is coming late to the market key rival sapporo is already wellestablished with the beerflavoured draft one suntory meanwhile is

mull jet fuel tax european union finance ministers are meeting on thursday in brussels where they are to discuss a controversial jet fuel tax a levy on jet fuel has been suggested as a way to raise funds to finance aid for the worlds poorest nations airlines and aviation bodies have reacted strongly against the plans saying they would hurt companies at a time when earnings are under pressure the eu said a tax would only be passed after full consultation with airlines it was keen to point out earlier this week that any new tax on jet fuel should not hurt the competitiveness of the airlines ministers will also be discussing reforms to regulations governing european public spending global leaders have focused attention on poverty reduction and development at recent meetings of the g group and world economic forum the worlds richest countries have said they want to boost the amount of aid they give to of their annual gross national income by many eu ministers are thought to support the plan to tax jet fuel tabled by france and germany following the recent g meeting at present the fuel used by airlines enjoys either a very low tax rate or is untaxed in eu member states china had role in yukos splitup china lent russia bn bn to help the russian government renationalise the key yuganskneftegas unit of oil group yukos it has been revealed the kremlin said on tuesday that the bn which russian state bank veb lent stateowned rosneft to help buy yugansk in turn came from chinese banks the revelation came as the russian government said rosneft had signed a longterm oil supply deal with china the deal sees rosneft receive bn in credits from chinas cnpc according to russian newspaper vedomosti these credits would be used to pay off the loans rosneft received to finance the purchase of yugansk reports said cnpc had been offered of yugansk in return for providing finance but the company opted for a longterm oil supply deal instead analysts said one factor that might have influenced the chinese decision was the possibility of litigation from yukos yugansks former owner if cnpc had become a shareholder rosneft and veb declined to comment the two companies rosneft and cnpc have agreed on the prepayment for longterm deliveries said russian oil official sergei oganesyan there is nothing unusual that the prepayment is for five to six years the announcements help to explain how rosneft a mediumsized indebted and relatively unknown firm was able to finance its surprise purchase of yugansk yugansk was sold for bn in an auction last year to help yukos pay off part of a bn bill in unpaid taxes and fines the embattled russian oil giant had previously filed for bankruptcy protection in a us court in an attempt to prevent the forced sale of its main production arm but yugansk was sold to a little known shell company which in turn was bought by rosneft yukos claims its downfall was punishment for the political ambitions of its founder mikhail khodorkovsky once the countrys richest man mr khodorkovsky is on trial for fraud and tax evasion the deal between rosneft and cnpc is seen as part of chinas desire to secure longterm oil supplies to feed its booming economy chinas thirst for products such as crude oil copper and steel has helped pushed global commodity prices to record levels clearly the chinese are trying to get some leverage in russia said dmitry lukashov an analyst at brokerage aton they understand property rights in russia are not the most important rights and they are more interested in guaranteeing supplies if the price of oil is fixed under the deal which is unlikely it could be very profitable for the chinese mr lukashov continued and rosneft is in desperate need of cash so its a good deal for them too deadline nears for fiatgm deal fiat and general motors gm have until midnight on february to settle a disagreement over a potential takeover the deadline marks the point at which fiat will gain the right to sell its car division to gm part

first time since may last year according to lending figures from the bank of england new loans in december rose to slightly higher than novembers nineyear low of mortgage lending rose by bn in december up from a bn rise in november the figures contradict a survey from the british bankers association which said approvals were at a fiveyear low analysts say the figures show the market may be stabilising but still point to further house price softness the modest rise in mortgage approvals and lending in december reinforces the impression that the housing market is currently slowing steadily rather than sharply said global insight analyst howard archer commenting on the boes figures the bba believes that the property market is continuing to cool down changes to mortgage regulation may have artificially depressed figures in november thus flattering the december figures analysts said in october last year new rules came into force which meant some lenders were forced to withdraw mortgage products temporarily in november and defer some lending until they had made sure they had complied with the rules properly separately the bank of england said that consumer credit

january according to a survey the chartered institute of purchasing and supply cips said its purchasing manager index pmi fell to from a revised in december but despite missing forecasts of the pmi number remained above indicating expansion in the sector the cips said that the strong pound had dented exports while rising oil and metals prices had kept costs high the survey added that rising input prices and cooling demand had deterred factory managers from hiring new workers in an effort to cut costs that triggered the second successive monthly fall in the cips employment index to its lowest level since june the survey is more upbeat than official figures which suggest that manufacturing is in recession but analysts said the survey did suggest that the manufacturing recovery was running out of steam it appears that the uk is in a twotier economy again said prebon yamane economist lena komileva you have weakness in manufacturing which i think would concern policymakers at the

turkcell is a security risk because of alleged business ties with israel parliament as a whole dominated by religious conservatives will vote on the ruling on tuesday turkcell said the ruling would make more difficult turkcells financial consolidation of irancell because its stake would be reduced to less than if management control and financial consolidation of irancell cannot be achieved the

strong dollar was in americas interest but analysts said any gains are likely to be shortlived as problems with the us economy were still significant they also pointed out that positive comments apart

snow who is currently in dublin at the start of a fournation eu visit has applauded irelands introduction of lower taxes and deregulation which have helped boost growth the eurozone is growing below its potential when a major part of the global economy is below potential there are negative consequences for the citizens of those economies and for their trading partners he said mr snows comments may have helped shore up the dollar on monday but he was careful to qualify his statement our basic policy of course is to let open competitive markets set the values he explained markets are driven by fundamentals and towards fundamentals us officials have also said that other economies need to grow so the us is not the main global growth engine economists say that the fundamentals or key indicators of the us economy are looking far from rosy domestic consumer demand is cooling and heavy spending by president bush has pushed the budget deficit to a record bn bn the current account

court saying his finance chief had a keen command of the numbers mr ebbers has denied charges of fraud and conspiracy during his second day of questioning in the new york trial mr ebbers played down his working relationship with mr sullivan and denied he frequently met him to discuss company business when questioned by the prosecution in a lot of weeks we would speak three or four times mr ebbers said adding that conversations about finances were rarely oneonone and were usually discussed by a group of people instead mr ebbers relationship to mr sullivan is key to the case surrounding financial corruption that led to the collapse of the firm in following the discovery of an bn accounting fraud the prosecutions star witness is mr sullivan one of six worldcom executives indicted in the case he has pleaded guilty to fraud and appeared as a prosecution witness as part of an agreement with prosecutors during his time on the witness stand mr sullivan repeatedly told jurors he met

the countrys economy the reserve bank of australia lifted interest rates to their first upwards move in more than a year however shortly after the bank made its decision new figures showed a fall in economic growth in the last quarter the bank said it had acted to curb inflation but the move was criticised by some analysts the rate hike was the first since december and had been wellflagged in advance however opposition parties and some analysts said the move was illtimed given data showing the australian economy grew just between october and december and on an annual basis the figures representing a decline from the growth in gdp seen between july and september were below market expectations consumer spending remains strong however and the bank is concerned about growing inflationary pressures over recent months it has become increasingly clear that remaining spare capacity in the labour and goods markets is becoming rather limited said ian macfarlane governor of the

an ongoing restructuring drive at the group also led to a m hit in the fourth quarter the worlds biggest insurer said analysts expect its latest round of cuts to focus on its brokerage unit which employs staff the latest layoffs will take the total number of jobs to go at the firm to and are expected to lead to annual savings of more than m as part of its efforts to cut costs the company said it was halving its dividend payment to cents a shares from cents a move which should enable it to save m looking ahead mr cherkasky forecast profitable growth for the year ahead with an operating

justice department is to try to overturn a court ruling that threw out its claim for bn bn in damages from tobacco firms earlier this month a threejudge appeal court panel rejected the claim filed in by the administration of bill clinton in a decision government lawyers said they would ask the full us court of appeals for the district of columbia to hear the case the court room battle is seen as key in government attempts to fight smoking its pretty clear that theyve suffered a severe setback said anthony sebok a professor at brooklyn law school adding that the appeal was what the government would be expected to ask for prosecutors had argued that tobacco firms lied about the dangers of smoking ignored research that highlighted problems looked to increase addiction by manipulating nicotine levels and targeted the young with their adverts among the firms accused were altria group rj reynolds tobacco lorillard tobacco liggett group and brown and williamson prosecutors went after the companies using legislation put in place to fight organised crime and accused the firms of conspiring and running racketeer influenced and corrupt organisations the tobacco companies denied the charges saying that they never illegally conspired to promote smoking and fool the public they also said that they have met many of the governments demands laid out in a landmark bn settlement hammered out in with states a threejudge panel agreed with the companies finding that the case could not be brought under federal antiracketeering laws central to the governments case was a meeting in the plaza hotel new york on december prosecutors contend that executives from the major tobacco firms met and agreed to present a unified strategy denying the harmful effects of smoking despite denying for decades that smoking could be linked to illness the companies have modified their stances in recent years altrias philip morris now accepts that nicotine is harmful and the companys main

usual engine of recovery faltered while domestic demand stayed subdued and corporate investment also fell short the growth falls well short of expectations but does mark a sixth straight quarter of expansion the economy had stagnated throughout the s experiencing only brief spurts of expansion amid long periods in the doldrums one result was deflation prices falling rather than rising which made japanese shoppers cautious and kept them from spending the effect was to leave the economy more dependent than ever on exports for its recent recovery but high oil prices have knocked off the growth rate while the falling dollar means products shipped to the us are becoming relatively more expensive the performance for the third quarter marks a sharp downturn from earlier in the year the first quarter showed annual growth of with the second showing and economists had been predicting as much as this time around exports slowed while capital spending became weaker said hiromichi shirakawa

embattled russian oil firm yukos has sued the russian government for bn bn the kremlin last year seized and sold yukos main production arm yugansk to staterun oil group rosneft for bn to offset a massive back tax bill group menatep the gibraltarbased holding company which controls of yukos says this was illegal menatep has already asked rosneft to repay a m loan that yugansk had secured on its assets the russian governments argument for selling yuganskneftegaz the units full name was that yukos owed more than bn in back taxes for the years from onwards it accused the firm of using a web of offshore firms to avoid its tax liabilities and the courts sent in bailiffs to freeze yukos accounts and seize yugansk but critics say the selloff and the assault on yukos finances are part of an attempt to bring the energy industry back under state control according to menatep the governments actions were contrary to the energy charter treaty which was designed to regulate disagreements over energy investments we have warned the russian government about their continuing attacks against yukos its personnel and its shareholders and we have warned any buyer of yuganskneftegaz that they would face a lifetime of litigation said tim osborne a director of group menatep the time for warning is over and actions to recover the value of our losses begin in earnest today menatep said the value of its yukos shareholding had gone from bn to virtually nothing since as a result of the russian governments action as its shares have fallen according to its paris lawyer emmanuel gaillard of shearman and sterling the overall claim is based on that figure with a addition for the share gains that could have accrued since then arbitration of the lawsuit could take place in stockholm or the hague mr gaillard said while russia has signed the charter it has never ratified it which some experts say could make it difficult for menatep to press its case but mr gaillard told bbc news that the charter came into effect on signature not ratification russia has said in the past that it is bound by it so as to attract foreign investors he said yukos is still waiting to see what will happen to its filing in a us court for bankruptcy protection it took the action to try to prevent the forced sale of yugansk first to a littleknown shell company which in turn was bought by rosneft yukos claims its downfall was punishment for the political ambitions of its founder mikhail khodorkovsky mr khodorkovsky currently facing fraud and tax evasion charges of his own was one of the founders of menatep he

union leaders in were meant to help europe leapfrog its way past the united states to become the worlds leading economy by but the lisbon targets are about much more than just economic prestige for many economists and analysts they are about ensuring europe doesnt become a global economic laggard they are also about ensuring europe can continue to compete as an equal with the growing economic giants of asia india and china as well as with the economic might of the united states thats why there was a tone of urgency in the report out on wednesday by the former dutch prime minister wim kok mr kok was commissioned by the european commission in march this year to assess how far the eu has come towards meeting the lisbon targets five years on from their inception his conclusion was simple too many of the targets will be seriously missed lisbon risks becoming a synonym for missed objectives and failed promises his report said the status quo is not an option at risk in the medium to long run is nothing less than the sustainability of the society europe has built it said the report comes at a time when europes competitive position is waning the eus economic growth rate is projected to be this year and next while there has been growth in overall employment rates in europe productivity lags behind that of the us but meeting the lisbon targets requires a political commitment that no eu member state has volunteered so far that has in part been due to the state of the global economy in the past few years as mr koks report noted the ink had scarcely dried on the lisbon agreement before the worldwide stock market bubble imploded the us suffered two years of economic slowdown and recession and the european economy followed suit the circumstances werent conducive to creating the million new jobs promised by eu leaders in lisbon in neither were they conducive to getting governments to spend more on research and development money needed if the eu was to meet its target of becoming a socalled knowledgebased economy the lisbon vision is a compelling one but in order to do it society has to change said paul hofheinz of the lisbon council a brusselsbased citizen action group what you find is that a lot of people have been fighting change you find trade unions fighting change but also the employers associations even though they tell you theyre in favour of change many are actually pushing for less competition more subsidy and less free market activity but part of the problem was also linked to the original targets set out in lisbon five years ago targets have a habit of coming back to haunt you and in the lisbon case they covered too much according to the wim report economic growth and job creation were linked to issues ranging from environmental protection to social inclusion and even safety at sea the agenda was just too broad and as a result nothing was prioritised lisbon is about everything and thus about nothing the kok report said everybody is responsible and thus no one thats why the kok report recommends that the lisbon targets be narrowed down to key indicators with an emphasis on creating jobs and economic growth it also recommends that the european commission draw up a league table which ranks countries according to the steps theyre taking towards meeting the targets effectively naming shaming and faming rhetoric and delivery dont necessarily go hand in hand mr kok said in a press conference alongside the publication of his report we dont have the luxury anymore just to exchange politeness with one another on one point mr kok was very clear the european union should not try to emulate the us economy the european economic and social model needs to change but not so much so that social and environmental issues take a backseat to economic growth in that sense the lisbon agenda is sailing into unchartered waters the kok report tries to do away with a belief that jobs need to be sacrificed at the altar of economic growth its very ambitious said john palmer political director at the european policy centre a brusselsbased thinktank this is something that no advanced economy in the world has tried to do its going to require quite new and innovative policies but some analysts believe that the kok report doesnt come up with the sort of innovative policies and thinking needed to make the lisbon targets a reality for example it recommends putting in place policies which encourage women and older people to remain in the workforce but it doesnt say how companies should be convinced to do this it will be up to the incoming president of the european commission jose manuel barroso to adopt mr koks recommendations and press them on eu governments mr barroso has said that the eus competitiveness will be his top priority he expects his fiveyear term in office to be judged on europes success in meeting the lisbon agenda malaysia lifts islamic bank limit malaysias central bank is to relax restrictions on foreign ownership to encourage islamic banking banks in malaysia will now be able to sell up to of their islamic banking units while the limit on other kinds of bank remains at rhb malaysias thirdbiggest lender is already scouting for a foreign partner for its new islamic banking unit the firm told reuters the moves put malaysia ahead of a deadline to open up the sector the

petrol engines for its sporty alfa romeo subsidiary unions at the italian carmaker have said the unions claim fiat is to close the fiat powertrain plant at arese near milan and instead source sixcylinder engines from general motors fiat has yet to comment on the matter but the unions say the new engines will be made by gm in australia the news comes a week after gm pulled out of an agreement to buy fiat gm had to pay former partner fiat bn euros bn bn to get out of a deal which could have forced it to buy the italian carmaker outright fiat and gm also ended their fiveyear alliance and two joint ventures in engines and purchasing but did agree to continue buying each others engines powertrain told us today that alfa romeo engines will no longer be made in arese said union leader vincenzo lilliu as reported by the reuters news agency the assembly line will be dismantled and the sixcylinder alfa romeo motor will be replaced with an engine gm produces in australia reuters also said that mr lilliu and other union bosses shouted insults at fiat chairman luca di montezemolo following a meeting on tuesday regarding the future of the arese plant the unions said the end of engine production at the facility would mean the loss of jobs all alfa romeo models can be bought with a sixcylinder engine the sportwagon gtv gt and spider saab to build cadillacs in sweden general motors the worlds largest car maker has confirmed that it will build a new mediumsized cadillac bls at its lossmaking saab factory in sweden the car unveiled at the geneva motor show is intended to compete in the mediumsized luxury car market it will not be sold in the us said gm europe president carlpeter forster as part of its efforts to make the us marque appeal to european drivers the car will be the first cadillac with a diesel engine gms announcement should go some way to allay fears of the saab factorys closure the factory in trollhaettan has been at the centre of rumours about gms planned severe cutbacks in its troubled european operations but the groups new commitment to the swedish factory may not be welcomed by the groups opel workers in ruesselsheim germany they may now have to face a larger proportion of gms cuts neither will the announcement be seen as unalloyed good news in sweden since it reflects saabs failure to make significant inroads into the lucrative european luxury car market for years saab has consistently said it is competing headon with bmw mercedes and jaguar the segments leaders do not agree gms plans to build the american marque in sweden is part of its efforts to push it as an alternative luxury brand for european drivers in the us it has long been established as an upmarket brand even the presidential limousine carries the badge yet it could prove tough for cadillac to steal market share from the majors in europe other luxury car makers most notably the toyota subsidiary lexus have enjoyed tremendous success in the us without managing to make significant inroads in europe there german marques mercedes benz and bmw have retained their stranglehold on the luxury market bringing cadillac production to sweden should help introduce desperatelyneeded scale to the saab factory which currently produces fewer than cars per year that is about half of what major car makers consider sufficient numbers for profitable operations and saab is losing money fast albeit with losses halved in to m m m euros from m the previous year beyond the job cuts announced last year at its european operations gm is reducing expenditure by building saabs opels badged as vauxhalls in the uk and now cadillacs on the same framework and by allowing the different brands to share parts another way to further reduce saabs losses could be to shift some of the production of saabs to the us a market where drivers have adopted it as an upmarket european car doing so would remove the exposure to the weak us dollar which is making saabs more expensive to us consumers but not everyone in the industry agree that it would be the best way forward we know that in five years the us dollar will be stronger than it is today the chief executive of a leading european car maker told bbc news the current trend towards us production was stupid he said in a separate announcement gm unveiled a new scheme to allow european consumers the chance to test drive its opel and vauxhall models it is to deploy a fleet of test cars across countries inviting potential buyers to try out a vehicle for hours it follows a similar initiative by gm in the us gm said it wanted to change customers perceptions about opel and vauxhall cars showing them that the quality had improved in recent years bank voted for no rate change the decision to keep interest rates on hold at earlier this month was passed by the bank of englands ratesetting body minutes have shown one member of the banks monetary policy committee mpc paul tucker voted to raise rates to the news surprised some analysts who had expected the latest minutes to show another unanimous decision worries over growth rates and consumer spending were behind the decision to freeze rates the minutes showed the banks latest inflation report released last week had noted that the main reason inflation might fall was weaker consumer spending however mpc member paul tucker voted for a quarter point rise in interest rates to he argued that economic growth was picking up and that the equity credit and housing markets had been stronger than expected the banks minutes said that risks to the inflation forecast were sufficiently to the downside to keep rates on hold at its latest meeting however the minutes added some members noted that an increase might be warranted in due course if the economy evolved in line with the central projection ross walker uk economist at royal bank of scotland said he was surprised that a dissenting vote had been made so soon he said the minutes appeared to be trying to get the market to focus on the possibility of a rise in rates if the economy pans out as they expect then they are probably going to have to hike rates however he added any rate increase is not likely to happen until later this year with mpc members likely to look for a more sustainable pick up in consumer spending before acting crude oil prices back above cold weather across parts of the united states and much of europe has pushed us crude oil prices above a barrel for the first time in almost three months freezing temperatures and heavy snowfall have

above s average of brent crude also rose in london trading adding to at the close much of western europe and the north east of america has been shivering under unseasonably low temperatures in recent days the decline in the us dollar to a fiveweek low against the euro has also served to inflate prices the dollar moved sharply overnight and oil is following it said chris furness senior market strategist at cast if the dollar continues to weaken oil will be obviously higher several opec members said a cut in production was unlikely citing rising prices and strong demand for oil from asia i agree that we do not need to cut supply if the prices are as much as this fathi bin shatwan libyas oil minister told reuters i do not think we need to cut unless the prices are falling below a barrel he added opec closely watches global stocks to ensure that there is not an excessive supply in the market the arrival of spring in the northern hemisphere will focus attention on stockpiles of us

had expected a bn euro payoff fiat is to get bn euros immediately with another m to follow within days the firm is italys largest private employer and a failure to reach an agreement could have had severe consequences for thousands of workers and for the italian economy for its part gm was keen to ward off any criticism that the deal had been a mistake we needed scale in europe to get costs down

sears admitted his guilt in breaking conflict of interest laws by recruiting darleen druyun while she still handled military contracts ms druyun is currently serving a nine month sentence for favouring boeing when awarding lucrative contracts boeing lost a bn government contract after a pentagon inquiry into the case the contract to provide refuelling tankers for the us air force was cancelled last year the pentagon revealed earlier this week that it would examine eight other contracts worth bn which it believes may have been tainted by ms druyuns role in the procurement process boeing sacked mr sears and ms druyun in november after allegations that they had violated company recruitment policy ms druyun had talks with mr sears in october about working for boeing while she was still a top procurement official within the pentagon she subsequently joined the company in january ms druyun admitted that she had steered multibillion dollar contracts to boeing and other favoured companies in documents filed in a virginia court ahead of mr sears sentencing prosecutors blamed boeings senior management for failing to ask key questions about the legal and ethical issues surrounding ms druyuns appointment mr sears told prosecutors that no other boeing officials were aware that ms druyun was still responsible for major procurement decisions at the time she was discussing a job with boeing however analysts believe boeing may yet face civil charges arising from the scandal the pentagon has investigated contracts dating back to since the allegations against ms druyun came to light boeings corporate ethics have come under scrutiny on several occasions in recent years boeing was sued by lockheed martin after its rival accused it of industrial espionage during

consolidating fast with former longdistance giant att being bought by former subsidiary sbc earlier this year for bn mci exited bankruptcy in april having gone bust under previous name worldcom the bankruptcy followed its admission in that it illegally booked expenses and inflated profits shareholders lost about bn when the company collapsed while workers lost their jobs former worldcom boss bernie ebbers is currently on trial accused of overseeing an bn fraud qwest has itself come under suspicion of substandard behaviour paying the securities and exchange commission m in october to settle charges that it manipulated its results to keep wall street happy mci is the uss secondbiggest long distance firm after att consolidation in the us telecommunications industry has picked up in the past few months as companies look to cut costs and boost client bases a merger between mci and verizon would be the fifth billiondollar telecoms deal since october last week sbc communications agreed to buy its former parent and phone trailblazer att for about bn buying mci would give either qwest or verizon access to mcis global network and businessbased subscribers the rationale is similar to the one underpinning sbcs att deal verizon is by far the bigger company and has its own successful mobile arm factors which may have swung the board in its favour since both suitors are offering a mixture of cash and shares us data sparks inflation worries wholesale prices in the us rose at the fastest rate in more than six years in january according to government data new figures show the labor department producer price index ppi rose by in line with forecasts but core producer prices which exclude food and energy costs surged by the biggest rise since december increasing inflationary concerns in contrast the university of michigan barometer of us retail consumer confidence showed a slight dip the universitys index of consumer spending fell to in early february from in january which could indicate a fall in retail spending by the us public the mixed set of data on friday led to volatile early wall street trade as the dow jones standard and poors and nasdaq swung between positive and negative territory the economic figures come on the back of increased fears that the federal reserve chairman may be about to raise interest rates in order to stifle any inflationary pressures the fed has been raising interest rates at a gradual pace since june in an attempt to make sure inflation does not get out of control mr greenspan told congress this week that the central bank was on guard against the possibility that a rebounding economy could trigger stronger inflation pressures the ppi would argue for greenspan to continue to raise rates at a measured pace said joe quinlan chief market stategist at bank of america capital management but this michigan survey tells you that the consumer might be downshifting a little bit in terms of their confidence and their spending this could be an indication of that consumer spending accounts for of us economic activity and is viewed as a gauge of the health of the economy which is why the michigan data is closely observed however on friday it was overshadowed by the core ppi core figure which surged during the past months the biggest yearonyear gain in nine years the concern is that traders might interpret this big jump in the core ppi as an impetus for the fed to be more aggressive than a measured move in moving rates said paul cherney chief market analyst at standard poors but ian shepherdson chief us economist at high frequency economics said the ppi report was much less alarming than at first glance onetime increases in alcohol and tobacco prices which are no indication of broad ppi pressure were responsible for the increase he said prices for autos and trucks also jumped in january but shepherdson said it is a good bet these increases wont stick yukos sues four firms

after yugansk was sold in december to settle back taxes the four companies named in the law suit are gas giant gazprom its unit gazpromneft investment company baikal and state oil firm rosneft yukos submitted the suit in houston where it filed for bankruptcy as well as suing for damages yukos has asked the us court to send its tax dispute with the russian government to an international arbitrator it also has submitted a reorganisation plan as part of its chapter bankruptcy filing the clash between yukos and the kremlin came to a head last year when yukos was hit with a bill of more than bn in back taxes and unpaid fines to settle the bill russia forced yukos to sell off yuganskneftegas yukos called the sale illegal and has turned to courts in the us in an effort to regain control of the oil production business it also has vowed to use all legal means at its disposal to go after any firm that tries to buy or take control of its assets earlier this month it sued the russian government for bn analysts have questioned whether a us court has any jurisdiction over russian companies while moscow officials have dismissed yukos legal wrangling as meaningless in houston bankruptcy judge letitia clark will start a twoday hearing on february to hear arguments on whether a us court is the proper forum for the case the threat of legal action from yukos and its bankruptcy filing in houston did have an effect on last years auction however concerned that it would be caught up in a court battle gazprom and gazpromneft withdrew from the auction and yuganskneftegas was sold to littleknown investment firm baikal finance group a few days later baikal gave control of the company to staterun oil group rosneft for bn rosneft meanwhile has agreed to merge with gazprom bringing a

growth us economic growth accelerated in the third quarter helped by strong consumer spending official figures have shown the economy expanded at an annual rate of in the july to september period the commerce department said the figure marked an increase on the growth recorded in the second quarter but fell short of the rate pencilled in by forecasters the increase reflected the biggest jump in consumer spending in a year it was a little softer than the consensus but not a real surprise said gary thayer an economist at ag edwards sons fridays growth estimate is one of the last significant pieces of economic data before the november presidential election democrat challenger john kerry has criticised president george w bushs handling of the economy pointing to a net loss of over jobs since mr bush took office analysts said the economy was still not growing fast enough to stimulate largescale job creation its a pretty good growth rate but it may not be good enough to create enough jobs said robert brusca chief economist at fact and opinion economics in new york however president bush is expected to point to commerce department figures showing that consumer spending grew at in the third quarter up from just in the second as evidence that his policies are generating solid growth consumer spending accounts for about two thirds of all economic activity in the us the weaker than expected growth figure makes it less likely that the us federal reserve will raise interest rates next month economists said the economy regained some traction in the third quarter but the growth is not robust ag edwards thayer i think that means the fed can take its time raising rates well probably see one more rate hike before the end of the year in an effort to preempt rising inflation the

gsk aims to stop aids profiteers one of the worlds largest manufacturers of hivaids drugs has launched an initiative to combat the smuggling of cheaper pills supplied to poorer african countries back into europe for resale at far higher price the company glaxosmithkline is to alter the packaging and change the colour of the pills currently provided to developing nations under a humanitarian agreement it is estimated that drugs companies are losing hundreds of millions of dollars each year as a result of the diversion of their products in this way this is a very sensitive area for the big drugs companies they want to maintain their profits but have been put under tremendous pressure to provide cheap antiaids drugs to the worlds poorest nations the result is that drugs supplied to africa are now more than thirty times cheaper than those sold in europe bringing these medicines within the reach of millions of hivpositive africans through their governments health care systems but the wide difference in price also means that there are big gains to be made from illegally diverting these cheaper drugs back into wealthier countries and reselling them at a higher price glaxosmithkline believes that by coating the pills destined for africa in a red dye and adding new identification codes both onto the pills and on the packaging then this trade can be substantially reduced the company says that it will then be possible to identify specific distributors in africa who have resold humanitarian drugs for profit as well as those suppliers in europe that have also been involved in the trade glaxo says distribution of the newlook drugs has already begun and that their chemical content is identical to those currently being sold in europe optimism remains over uk housing the uk property market remains robust despite the recent slowdown according to mortgage lender bradford bingley and housebuilder george wimpey bb said the buytolet market in which the bank is a major player would continue to grow much faster than the wider mortgage market the comments came as it reported a rise in profits to m m wimpey reported a rise in profits to m and said recent new home reservations were better than expected recent housing market surveys have indicated that the uk property market has cooled in recent months after several years of rapid growth last week figures from the council of mortgage lenders cml indicated that the popularity of buytolet mortgages a key phenomenon of the housing boom could be waning but bb which has a share of the uk buytolet mortgage market said that while rates of growth were moderating the sector continues to grow at a rate considerably above that of the whole mortgage market overall bb said that housing market fundamentals remain strong interest rates and unemployment are both likely to remain at historically low levels real household incomes should continue to grow and housing demand is likely to outstrip supply into the mediumterm despite the upbeat tone shares in bb were down more than at p in morning trade as analysts worried over future earnings growth wimpeys profit figures came in at the top of expectations with the numbers helped by buoyant sales in the us offsetting a slight slowdown in the uk wimpey said the uk housing market had proved challenging last year by late summer the market in general had slowed sharply across the country and showed no real improvement during the autumn it added however the first seven weeks of this year had produced promising signs wimpey said visitor levels and

russias proposed membership of the world trade organisation wto have been making good progress say those behind the negotiations but the chairman of the working party ambassador stefan johannesson of

must renew a commitment to democracy and the rule of law his comments come three days before he is due to meet president vladimir putin russia has been waiting for a decade to join the wto and hopes to finally become a member by early a decision could be reached in december when the wtos current members gather for a summit in hong kong that would allow an earliest date for membership of january if the hong kong summit gave its approval while pinpointing several areas in which there are difficulties in the bilateral and multilateral work with russia the us said the meeting was much more efficient than weve seen for some time and australia said it was one of the best meetings we can recall in terms of substance mr johannesson also said progress on the bilateral market access side is accelerating sticking points to membership have included limits on foreign ownership in the telecommunications and life insurance businesses as well as issues surrounding counterfeiting piracy and

dropped against major currencies on concerns that central banks may cut the amount of dollars they hold in their foreign reserves comments by south koreas central bank at the end of last week have sparked the recent round of dollar declines south korea which has about bn in foreign reserves said it plans instead to boost holdings of currencies such as the australian and canadian dollar analysts reckon that other nations may follow suit and now ditch the dollar at gmt the euro was up on the day at euros per us dollar the british pound had added to break through the level while the dollar had fallen by against the japanese yen to trade at yen at the start of the year the us currency which had lost against the euro in the final three months of and had fallen to record lows staged something of a recovery analysts however pointed to the dollars inability recently to extend that rally despite positive economic and corporate data and highlighted the fact that many of the uss economic problems had not disappeared the focus once again has been on the countrys massive trade and budget deficits with predictions of more dollar weakness to come the comments from korea came at a time when sentiment towards the dollar was already softening said ian gunner a trader at mellon financial on tuesday traders in asia said that both south korea and taiwan had withdrawn their bids to buy dollars at the start of the session mansoor mohiuddin chief currency strategist at ubs said that there was a sentiment in the market that central banks from asia and the middle east are buying euros a

together in a series of energy deals part of a pact which could see india invest up to bn in oil and gas projects on the agenda are oil and gas extraction as well as transportation deals to be led by russian energy giant gazprom and indias ongc the indian firm is also expected to hold talks on tuesday about buying a stake in assets once owned by yukos it is reported to be keen on buying a stake in oil unit yuganskneftegas the former yukos subsidiary was controversially sold off last year and eventually acquired by stateowned energy giant rosneft russian media reported that india and russia signed a memorandum of understanding on energy cooperation on tuesday during a meeting between oil and natural gas corporation chairman subir raha gazprom chairman aleksey miller and indias petroleum minister mani shankar aiyar the agreement is likely to see the two companies develop refining facilities in russia india and elsewhere and organise delivery of oil gas and petrochemicals from russia to india and other countries across asia ongc could invest in gas and oil fields in sakhalin in the far east of russia and may also take part in joint tender bids for projects in eastern siberia and the caspian sea india is urgently searching for fresh energy supplies particularly liquefied natural gas as domestic demand is growing at more than a year ongcs mr raha said the two could work together on joint bids from next year at current oil and gas prices our cash flow situation is good he told reuters what we are saying is gazprom has a huge amount of gas and we have the money the investment may go up to bn or more for a period of five years or so russian news agencies reported that indias petroleum minister mr aiyar and russian energy minister viktor khristenko would discuss the future of yugansk at a meeting on tuesday ongcs mr raha declined to be drawn on his firms reported interest in the company however he stressed that ongc was not interested in a loanforoil deal in connection to yugansk similar to that concluded recently between rosneft and chinas national petroleum corporation chinas problem is it has immediate demand and they needed the oil for their coastal refineries we do not we would like longterm security through equity participation it is thought that any decision over yugansk will be delayed until a us court has decided whether to grant yukos bankruptcy protection yukos is suing a host of companies involved in the sale of yugansk auctioned off to pay a huge backtax bill it has also threatened legal action against any business which has future commercial dealings with its former subsidiary weak data buffets french economy a batch of downbeat government data has cast doubt over the french economys future prospects official figures showed on friday that unemployment was unchanged at last month while consumer confidence fell unexpectedly in october at the same time finance minister nicolas sarkozy warned that high oil prices posed a threat to french growth oil prices will weigh on consumer spending in the short term and potentially on confidence he said world oil prices have risen by more than since the start of the year as production struggles to keep pace with soaring demand analysts said french companies keen to protect their profit margins at a time of rising energy costs were reluctant to take on extra staff the unemployment figures show the main problem of the french economy we have growth but without an improvement in employment said marc touati an economist at natexis banques populaires politicians must have the will and guts to solve structural unemployment with thorough reforms otherwise in five or ten years it will be too late obligatory employer contributions to worker welfare programmes mean that it costs more to hire staff in france than in many other european economies many economists have urged the government to stimulate employment by reducing nonwage payroll costs and by scrapping restrictions on working hours the french statistics agency insee expects the economy to grow by about this year buoyed by strong consumer spending and business investment that is above the projected eurozone average of just above business fears over sluggish eu economy as european leaders gather in rome on friday to sign the new eu constitution many companies will be focusing on matters much closer to home namely how to stay in business lille is a popular tourist destination for britons who want a taste of france at the weekend but how many tourists look at the impressively grand victorian chambre de commerce which stands beside the opera house and consider that it was built like the town halls in many northern english towns on the wealth created by coal steel and textiles like northern england and industrial scotland those industries have been in long term decline the last coal pit closed in beckcrespel is a specialist steel firm in armentieres about miles from lille the company has not laid off a worker since it specialises in making bolts and fixings for power stations and the oil industry but not many of those are being built in europe these days director hugues charbonnier says he is under pressure because factories in the far east are able to make some of his output more cheaply while his key markets are now in china and india in our business the market is absolutely global you can not imagine living with our size of business even within an enlarged european union if we did that we would need not people but perhaps just or he says it isnt just globalisation that is hurting the law in france means workers are paid for a hour week even though they work just hours but at least there is still a steel industry coal has now totally vanished and textiles are struggling new business has been attracted but not enough to make up the difference that is one reason why people here are not great fans of the eu says frederic sawicki a politics lecturer at the university of lille in the region today the unemployment rate is in some areas it is they dont see what europe is doing for them so there is a kind of euro scepticism especially in the working classes he says which is strange because lille is at the crossroads of europe if anywhere should be benefiting from the euro it is here the euro was designed to increase trade within the eurozone but the biggest increase in trade has been with the rest of the world much of that trade passes through the worlds largest port rotterdam in holland home to specialist crane maker huisman itrec its cranes help build oil rigs and lifted the sunken russian submarine kursk from the sea bed but huisman itrec is now setting up a factory in china where costs are cheaper and its main customers are closer boss henk addink blames the low growth rate in europe for the lack of orders closer to home in the us growth is something like in china they are estimating and in the eu it is more or less he says mr addink blames the euro for stifling demand he much preferred the old currencies of europe which moved in relation to each countrys economic performance in germany industry is exporting more these days but the economy as a whole is once again mired in slow growth and high unemployment growth is likely to peak this year at just under in britain that would be a bad year in germany it is one of the best in recent years with germany making up a third of the eurozones economy this is a major problem if germany doesnt once again become the powerhouse of europe growth across the bloc is never going to be as strong as it could be however at one factory near the dutch border things are changing the siemens plant at boscholt makes cordless phones and employs staff staff have started working an extra four hours a week for no extra pay after siemens threatened to take the factory and their jobs to hungary factory manager herbert stueker says that he now hopes to increase productivity by nearly but germany needs much more reform if all its industry is to compete with places such hungary or china the government is reforming the labour market and cutting the generous unemployment system but the real solution is to cut the wages of low skilled workers says helmut schneider director of the institute for the study of labour at bonn university labour is too costly in germany especially for the low skilled labour and this is the main problem if we could solve that problem we could cut unemployment by half he says the eu set itself the target of being the most efficient economy in the world by four years into that process and the target seems further away than ever ms cuts prices by average of marks spencer has cut prices in london and the regions by an

growth accelerated in the last three months of driven by consumer spending a report shows gross domestic product gdp rose by in the fourth quarter compared with the previous three month period the statistical office insee said that expansion pushed annual growth to the fastest rate in two years consumer spending was up by in the fourth quarter and there also was a rebound in business investment that gave the recovery an extra shove analysts warned that france still was facing challenges and was unlikely to keep expanding at its current pace france still has a strong economic growth said marc toutai an economist at natexis banques populaires but if we check the figures in detail theres a problem consumer spending is still high but french households have spent their savings to consume france cant sustain a high growth rate without an improvement in the job market theres too much of a gap between growth and employment unemployment levels are currently stuck at about and is proving difficult to bring down despite government efforts another worry is that demand in germany and italy two of frances main trading partners is sluggish despite the concerns analysts pointed out that france was outperforming the majority of its european counterparts and that its economy was looking more robust than in previous years as well as strong domestic demand exports climbed by in the fourth quarter the biggest increase in foreign sales for a year its an economic growth that seems well balanced said nicolas claquin an analyst at ccf in the beginning of growth was mainly driven by consumer spending here it gets contributions from investment and exports though household consumption is still strong but we expect overall economic growth to fall to percent in us regulator to rule on pain drug us food and drug regulators will decide on friday whether to recommend the sale of painkillers that have been linked to a high risk of heart attack and stroke the food and drug administration fda advisory panel will give its verdict after hearing evidence for three days the painkillers called cox inhibitors are sold under brand names such as celebrex and vioxx vioxx was withdrawn from shops last year but merck said it would consider selling it if it gets fda approval the fda has been asked to decide if the benefits to patients justify the increased risks putting vioxx back on the shelves is likely to boost profits at merck and make easier any legal battles with people who claim to have been injured by the drug analysts said merck voluntarily stopped sales of vioxx on september a move which caused the firms fourthquarter earnings to slide to bn m from bn a year earlier mercks shares tumbled more than on the news and the company has had to set aside millions of dollars to cover the cost of vioxxrelated litigation alarm bells were rung by a research note called approve which showed that the risk of heart attack and stroke doubled in patients who had been taking the drug for at least months the cox inhibitors were developed by drug companies including merck and pfizer because they cause users fewer stomach problems than other painkillers pfizer is still selling its celebrex and bextra products though investigations have suggested that they may also be harmful to the heart mercks announcement of a possible reintroduction of vioxx caught analysts by surprise mercks head of research peter kim said that it withdrew vioxx based on the information that was available to us at the time knowing there were alternative therapies he went on to say that things have since changed in the light of new reports given this new information its is not clear that the cardiovascular risk observed in approve makes vioxx unique in the class of similar drugs marketed in the us mr kim explained on thursday david graham from the fdas office of drug safety told the advisory panel that there really doesnt appear to be a need for cox inhibitors according to calculations presented to the us senate by dr graham in november vioxx may be linked to as many as to american deaths facing stem criticism for its handling of the vioxx case the fda said on tuesday that it will create an independent body to oversee the safety of drugs already in the market place european regulators meanwhile ruled on thursday that patients who have had heart disease or a stroke should not take cox inhibitors the european medicines agency also said doctors should be cautious about giving the drugs to patients who have risk factors for heart disease borussia

according to niesr if the governments current economic cycle runs until march then it is unlikely the golden rule will be met should the cycle end a year earlier then the chances improve to either way fiscal tightening is needed niesr said the report is the latest to call into question the viability of government spending projections earlier this month accountancy firm ernst young said that chancellor of the exchequer gordon browns forecasts for tax revenues were too optimistic it claimed revenues were likely to be bn below estimates by the end of the tax year despite the economy growing in line with forecasts a treasury spokesperson dismissed the latest claims saying it was on track to meeting spending rules and the golden rule in the current cycle and beyond spending plans have been

whose sale was being reviewed mr yushchenko had previously said the list would be limited to enterprises more than businesses in all from massive corporations to tiny shopfronts have been sold off

renewed sale georgia plans hidden asset pardon georgia is offering a oneoff tax amnesty to people who hid their earnings under the regime of former president eduard shevardnadze the countrys new president mikhail saakashvili has said that anyone now willing to disclose their wealth will only have to pay in income tax the measure is designed to legitimise previously hidden economic activity and boost georgias flagging economy georgias black market is estimated to be twice the size of its legal economy mr saakashvili elected president in january after mr shevardnadze was toppled has urged the georgian parliament to approve the amnesty as soon as possible it is one of a series of proposals designed to tackle corruption which was rampant during the shevardnadze era and boost georgias fragile public finances the new government is encouraging companies to pay taxes by scrapping existing corruption investigations and destroying all tax records from before january three days before president saakashvili was elected there are people who have money but are afraid to show it the president told a government session documentation about where this money came from doesnt exist because under the former entirely warped regime earning capital honestly was not possible by declaring their assets and paying the oneoff tax people would be able to legalise their property mr saakashvili stressed no one will have the right to check this moneys origin this money must go back into the economy the amnesty will not extend to people who made money through drugs trafficking or international money laundering criminal investigations in such cases thought to involve about of georgian businesses are to continue mr saakashvili has accused the shevardnadze regime which was toppled by a popular uprising in november of allowing bribery to flourish georgias economy is in a desperate condition half the population are living below the poverty line with many surviving on income of less than or three euros a day the unemployment rate is around while the country has a bn public debt cuba winds back economic clock fidel castros decision to ban all cash transactions in us dollars in cuba has once more turned the spotlight on cubas ailing economy all conversions between the us dollar and cubas convertible peso will from november be subject to a tax cuban citizens who receive money from overseas and foreign visitors who change dollars in cuba will be affected critics of the measure argue that it is a step backwards reflecting the cuban presidents desire to increase his control of the economy and to clamp down on private enterprise in a live television broadcast announcing the measure president castros chief aide said it was necessary because of the united states increasing economic aggression the ten percent obligation applies exclusively to the dollar by virtue of the situation created by the new measures of the us government to suffocate our country he said the bush administration has taken an increasingly harsh line on cuba in recent months president bushs government which has been a strong supporter of the yearold trade embargo on cuba introduced even tighter restrictions on cuba in may cubans living in the us are now limited to one visit to cuba every three years and they can only send money to their immediate relatives a leading expert on the cuban economy says that castros tax plan smacks more of a desperate economic measure than a political gesture i think it is primarily an effort to raise some cash says jose barrionuevo head of strategy for latin american emerging markets for barclays capital it underscores the fact that the economy is in very bad shape and the government is looking for sources of revenue the tax will hit the families of cuban exiles hardest as they benefit from the money their displaced relatives send home this money known as remittances can amount to as much as bn a year those remaining in cuba will have to pay the tax their relatives abroad may choose to send money in other currencies which are not subject to the tax such as euros or increase their dollar payments to compensate however many of cubans poorest citizens could be worse off as a result the tax will also affect the two million tourists who visit cuba every year particularly those americans who continue to defy a ban on travel there cubas tourist industry has been one of its few economic success stories over the last ten years and according to the un economic commission for latin america is now worth bn to the country the tax is designed to provide muchneeded revenue for cubas cashstrapped economy cuba badly needs dollars to pay for essential items such as food fuel and medicine much of cubas basic infrastructure is in a state of disrepair in recent weeks cuba has suffered its most serious power cuts in a decade and there have also been water shortages in parts of the island cubas economy had staged a modest recovery during the mid s as the collapse of the soviet union forced it to embrace foreign capital decentralise trade and permit limited private enterprise however a decline in foreign tourism since periodic hurricanes and the increasing costs of importing oil have put a strain on the economy it has however yet to be seen if the tax will provide a solution to the governments economic problems the tax could fuel an active black market in currency trading mr barrionuevo said the main impact could be that it will create a black market which you typically see in countries like venezuela which have restrictions on capital he says mr barrioneuvo says the measure could be dropped if it has a damaging effect on economic activity it is intended to be a permanent measure but i am not sure it can last

sell them more cheaply as they do not have to pay research and development cost there are more than generic drugmakers worldwide and analysts have predicted consolidation in a market that they call

budget deficit defence spending will rise however while the proposals exclude the cost of continuing military operations in iraq vicepresident dick cheney said the budget was the tightest so far at the heart of the administrations fifth budget presented to congress on monday is an austere package of domestic measures these would see discretionary spending rise below the projected level of inflation such belttightening is designed to tackle the massive budget deficit increases of president bushs first term mr cheney admitted that the budget was the toughest of the bush presidency but argued it was fair and responsible it is not something we have done with a meat axe nor are we suddenly turning our back on the most needy people in our society he said the wars in iraq and afghanistan increased expenditure on national security after and the recession wiped out the budget surplus inherited by president bush in and turned it into a record deficit the shortfall is projected to rise to bn in education environmental protection and transport initiatives are set to be scaled back as a first step towards reducing the deficit to bn by most controversially the government is seeking to cut the medicaid budget which provides health care to the nations poorest by bn and to reduce farm subsidies by m spending on defence and homeland security is set to increase although not by as much as originally planned president bushs proposals would see the pentagons budget rise by bn to bn while homeland security would get an extra bn the budget does not include the cost of running military operations in iraq and afghanistan for which the administration in expected to seek an extra bn from congress later this year also not featuring in the proposals is the cost of funding the administrations radical proposed overhaul of social security provision some expects believe this could require borrowing of up to bn trillion over a twenty year period despite the republicans holding a majority in both houses of congress the proposals will be fiercely contested over the next few months john mccain a republican senator said he was pleased the administration was prepared to tackle the deficit with the deficits that we are now running i am glad the president is coming over with a very austere budget he said however democratic senator kent conrad said the

by revaluing its holdings the imf may be able to sell billions of dollars of gold and use the cash to cancel debts owed by the worlds poorest nations the plan was put forward by g finance ministers over the weekend the price of gold fell to an ounce in asia before rebounding slightly in early european trading imf boss rodrigo rato was asked by g ministers to carry out a study into the feasibility of revaluing and selling gold reserves he is expected to present his conclusions at an imf meeting in washington during april whatever happens the market is going to be disconcerted and on the back foot until the april imf meetings said john reade an analyst at ubs the imf values its gold reserves at between and an ounce a price that was fixed in the s and is about a tenth of the metals current market value the imf has tonnes of gold or about m ounces bringing the book price of the gold in line with market value would boost the imfs balance sheet giving it more money to distribute this idea has been put forward before but there now seems to be a more committed political drive to address the issue of global poverty this is the first time there has been a mention of the use of gold in a g communiqu for achieving debt relief said uk chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown at their meeting in london g finance ministers backed plans to write off up to of the debts owed by some of the worlds poorest countries mr brown said the meeting would be remembered as the debt relief summit while debt relief seems to have jumped to the top of the global agenda not everyone is convinced that selling imf gold is the best way forward the us which can veto any plan to sell imf gold should it so choose said it is looking at other ways of solving the problem the us is not convinced thats the necessary way to do it said treasury under secretary john taylor canada a key gold producer also expressed reservations electronics firms eye plasma deal consumer electronics

genius smith us federal reserve chairman alan greenspan has given a speech at a scottish church in honour of the pioneering economist adam smith he delivered the th adam smith lecture in kirkcaldy fife the adam smith lecture celebrates the author of s wealth of nations which became a bible of capitalism dr greenspan was invited by chancellor gordon brown whose minister father john used to preach at the st bryce kirk church mr brown introduced dr greenspan to the invited guests as the the worlds greatest economist dr greenspan who has been in the uk to attend the g meeting in london said the world could never repay the debt of gratitude it owed to smith whose genius he compared to that of mozart he said the philosopher was a towering contributor to the modern world kirkcaldy the birthplace in of adam smith and by extension of modern economics is also of course where your chancellor was reared i am led to ponder to what extent the chancellors renowned economic and financial skills are the result of exposure to the subliminal intellectenhancing emanation in this area he continued smith reached far beyond the insights of his predecessors to frame a global view of how market economics just then emerging worked in so doing he supported changes in societal organisation that were to measurably enhance standards of living dr greenspan said smiths revolutionary philosophy on human selfinterest laissezfaire economics and competition had been a force for good in the world the incredible insights of a handful of intellectuals of the enlightenment especially with smith toiling in the environs of kirkcaldy created the modern vision of people free to choose and to act according to their individual selfinterest he said following his lecture dr greenspan who received an honorary knighthood from the queen at balmoral in was awarded an honorary fellowship of the royal society of edinburgh he later opened an exhibition dedicated to smith in the atrium of fife college of further and higher education joyce johnston principal of the college said it is very fitting that the worlds premier economist delivered this lecture in tribute to the worlds first

watchdogs chairman has said he is willing to soften tough new us corporate governance rules to ease the burden on foreign firms in a speech at the london school of economics william donaldson promised several initiatives european firms have protested that us laws introduced after the enron scandal make wall street listings too costly the us regulator said foreign firms may get extra time to comply with a key clause in the sarbanesoxley act the act comes into force in mid it obliges all firms with us stock market listings to make declarations which critics say will add substantially to the cost of preparing their annual accounts firms that break the new law could face huge fines while senior executives risk jail terms of up to years mr donaldson said that although the act does not provide exemptions for foreign firms the securities and exchange commission sec would continue to be sensitive to the need to accomodate foreign structures and requirements there are few if any who disagree with the intentions of the act which obliges chief executives to sign a statement taking responsibility for the accuracy of the accounts but european firms with secondary listings in new york have objected arguing that the compliance costs outweigh the benefits of a dual listing the act also applies to firms with more than us shareholders a situation many firms without us listings could find themselves in the shareholder threshold has drawn anger as it effectively blocks the most obvious remedy a delisting mr donaldson said the sec would consider whether there should be a new approach to the deregistration process for foreign firms unwilling to meet us requirements we should seek a solution that will preserve investor protections without turning the us market into one with no exit he said he revealed that his staff were already weighing up the merits of delaying the implementation of the acts least popular measure section for foreign firms seen as particularly costly to implement section obliges chief executives to take responsibility for the firms internal controls by signing a compliance statement in the annual accounts the sec has already delayed implementation of this clause for smaller firms including us ones with market capitalisations below m m a delegation of european firms visited the sec in december to press for change the financial times reported it was led

strong both operationally and financially the company is earning about m an hour despite the record annual profits figure bps performance was below the expectations of some city analysts however bps share price rose p or nearly in morning trading to p its profit rise for the year included profits of bn bn for the final three months of up from bn a year ago but below its third quarter speaking on the bbcs today programme on tuesday lord browne said the profits were not solely down to the high oil price alone the profits are up more than the price of oil is up he said lord browne pointed out that bp was reaping the benefits of its investment in oil exploration we have spent many years buying assets when the price is low he said the company has made new discoveries in egypt the gulf of

agreement miner highland gold said it regretted any limit on privatisation while bp a big investor declined to comment only firms at least russianowned will be permitted to bid the federal natural resources agency said the government is interested in letting russian companies develop strategic resources the foreign ownership issue will be dealt with according to russias competition law natural resources minister yuri trutnev was quoted as saying by the interfax news agency no further details were given with mr trutnev suggesting that russia may decide on a casebycase basis observers said that the move may represent a shift in policy as the administration of vladimir putin puts the protection of national interests above free market dynamics russia recently wrested back control of a large chunk of its oil industry from stockmarket listed company yukos a move that prompted calls of outrage from many investors analysts warned that it was still too early to draw too many conclusions from this new set of proposals companies echoed this sentiment saying that they would require more information before ringing the alarm bells its not good but it is very understandable said al breach an economist at ubs brunswick but if the investment climate is stable thats much more important foreigners of course would like to have free entry but this is not the end of the world a number of other nations including mexico saudi arabia and kuwait protect their national resources from foreign firms what has surprised observers is that since the collapse of communism russia has been courting foreign investment bp spent bn to create russianregistered oil company tnkbp and has a partnership to develop the sakhalin petroleum field with stateowned rosneft exxon the worlds largest oil company has signed preliminary agreements to develop the sakhalin field company spokesman glenn waller said exxon still considered the deal valid despite russia inviting new offers for the land block

the motto bringing russias gold to market it would be a shame if that has a negative impact on the investment climate other firms that have been linked with investment in russia include frances total

change and change now said mr prettejohn who wants it to move from disclosure on request to mandatory disclosure the call came in a speech on improving the london insurance market the fsa should not bide their time and wait and see they should seize the moment mr prettejohn lloyds chief executive said the fsa took over regulation of the general insurance sector in january but it sidestepped calls to require brokers to disclose the commissions they earn from insurers to their clients last week the city watchdog gave brokers and insurers guidance on managing conflicts of interest brokers must give information on their commissions if and only if their customers request it the fsa said in the us lack of transparency about brokers commissions has led to problems the worlds biggest insurance broker marsh mclennan said last week it would pay m to settle charges raised by new york attorney general eliot spitzer in october that it sought to rig bids in conjunction with insurers the probe centred around socalled contingent commissions whereby brokers were rewarded according to how much business they brought to an insurer an arrangement that did not always benefit brokers customers all

paid for online or by phone has risen since the start of the introduction of chip and pin cards has tightened security for transactions on the high street but the clampdown has caused fraudsters to change tack retail decisions said the introduction of chip and pin cards aimed to cut down on credit card fraud in stores by asking shoppers to verify their identity with a confidential personal pin number instead of a signature retail decisions chief executive carl clump told the bbc that there was no doubt that chip and pin would reduce card fraud in the cardpresent environment however it is important to monitor what happens in the cardnotpresent environment as fraudsters will turn their attention to the internet mail order telephone order and interactive tv he said we have seen a uplift in cardnotpresent fraud here in the uk since the start of the year fraud doesnt just disappear it mutates to the next weakest link in the chain he said retail decisions survey on the implementation of chip and pin found that shoppers had adapted easily to the new system but that banks performance in distributing the new cards had been patchy at best the main issue is that not everyone has the pins they need said mr clump nearly two thirds of the people interviewed said they had used chip and pin to make payments of these were happy with the experience though nearly a quarter said they struggled to remember their pin number however only said they had received replacement cards with the necessary chip technology from all their card providers furthermore said that none of their cards had been

into pensions employers have spent billions of pounds propping up their final salary pensions over the past year research suggests a survey of schemes by incomes data services ids said employer contributions had increased from bn to bn a year a rise of companies facing the biggest deficits had raised their pension contributions by or more ids said many firms are struggling to keep this type of scheme open because of rising costs and increased liabilities a final salary scheme also known as a defined benefit scheme promises to pay a pension related to the salary the scheme member is earning when they retire the rising cost of maintaining such schemes has led many employers to replace final salary schemes with money purchase or defined contribution schemes these are less risky for employers under money purchase schemes employees pay into a pension fund which is used to buy an annuity a policy which pays out an income until death on retirement ids said there were some schemes in good health but in many cases firms had been forced to top up funds to tackle yawning deficits the level of contributions paid by employers has increased gradually since the late s in for example contributions rose by and in by in contrast between and some employers cut their contribution levels helen sudell editor of the ids pensions service said the rise in contributions was staggering and the highest ever recorded by ids we have warned before that the widespread closure of final salary schemes to new entrants is just the beginning of a much bigger movement away from paternalistic provision said ms sudell with figures like this there can be little doubt that many employers will have to reduce future benefits at some point for those staff still in these schemes uk homes hit trillion total the value of the uks housing stock reached the trillion mark in triple the value years earlier a report indicates research from halifax the countrys biggest mortgage lender suggests the value of private housing stock is continuing to rise steadily all regions saw at least a doubling in their assets during the past decade but northern ireland led the way with a rise while scotland saw the smallest increase of just the core retail price index rose by just in the same period underlining how effective an investment in housing has been for most people during the past decade more than a third of the uks private housing assets representing more than a trillion pounds in value are concentrated in london and the south east the halifaxs figures indicate tim crawford group economist at

interest rate rises according to a report optimism is at its highest since and business will reap the benefits of a continuing rise in public spending say researchers at bdo stoy hayward the bank of england is expected to keep rates on hold this week but they could go up later in the year rates are likely to rise after the anticipated general election in may the bdo optimism index a leading indicator of gdp growth two quarters ahead edged up in january to from in october the rise is due in part to an increase in public spending and increased merger and acquisition activity the only thing blighting business optimism this year will be uncertainties associated with the general election bdo said its bdos output index which predicts gdp movements a quarter in advance remained at for january implying gdp growth at in the second quarter of however the output index is being held back by recent interest rate rises sterlings strength against the dollar and high oil prices the group

after the club confirmed it had received a fresh takeover approach from us business tycoon malcolm glazer no formal offer has been made yet but manchester united have confirmed they have received a detailed proposal from the us entrepreneur which could lead to a bid reports have put the offer at p per share which would value manchester united at about m bn the approach by the yearold owner of the tampa bay buccaneers american football team is reportedly being led by his two sons avi and joel a previous approach to the united board by mr glazer in october last year was turned down however the bbc has learnt that the club is unlikely to reject the latest plan out of hand mr glazers previous offer involved borrowing large amounts of money to finance any takeover that would have left the club with debt levels which were deemed not in the best interests of the company by manchester uniteds board when they rejected his approach last year however mr glazers latest offer is reported to have cut the amount of borrowing needed by m while uniteds board may be casting a serious eye over mr glazers latest proposals supporters remain fiercely opposed to any deal supporters group shareholders united which has proved adept in rallying opposition to mr glazers campaign said it would fight any move manchester united are a debtfree company we dont want to fall into debt and we dont need to fall into debt shareholders uniteds sean bones told the bbc uniteds players also appear unhappy at the prospect of a takeover a lot of people want the clubs interest to be with people who have grown up with the club and got its interests at heart rio ferdinand told bbc radio five live noone knows what this guy will be bringing to the table the key to any successful bid will be attracting the support of uniteds largest shareholders the irish horse racing tycoons john magnier and jp mcmanus through their cubic expression vehicle they own of the club mr glazer owns joe mclean a football specialist at accountancy firm grant thornton said the support of mr magnier and mr mcmanus was utterly crucial mr glazers bid will not proceed without their support and they have previously indicated that they are holding their stake as an investment if thats the case the shares will therefore need a price attachment of about pence maybe if thats the case then mr glazer might well secure their support if he does this bid could well go ahead indeed it is malcolm glazer was littleknown in the uk until he started to build up his stake in manchester united in late in february he said he was considering whether to bid for the club no bid emerged but mr glazer continued to increase his holding in the club in october manchester united said they had received a preliminary approach which turned out to have come from mr glazer however the board rejected the move because of the amount of debt it would involve at the clubs annual general meeting in november mr glazer took revenge by using his hefty stake in the club to oust three directors from the board legal adviser maurice watkins commercial director andy anson and nonexecutive director philip yea were voted out against the wishes of chief executive david gill but the move led to bankers jp morgan and public relations firm brunswick withdrawing from the glazer bid team making your office work for you our

to the bottom of the story to find out how to get in touch working from home presents a multitude of challenges understanding your work personality allows you to work in terms of your own style do you feel confident about your work output without conferring with others are you able to retain discipline and self motivate to get the job done do you build on the ideas of others or are you a more introspective problem solver in order for a virtual office to succeed keeping the boundary between work and home life is essential it may be useful to be quite rigid about who is allowed to visit and to keep strict office hours referring to the space as work will give those around you a clear message that this is professional space it is imperative to consider how to bring the outside world into yours keeping up to date with developments and maintaining a network isolated work environments mean this has to be carefully thought out and a strategy has to be developed that suits both your personality and your industry joining professional groups or forming a loose association of likeminded people may assist it is useful to structure these meetings in advance as often they get relegated to less important status when times are busy with the danger that when the workload eases they have to be resurrected prior to any interior work being undertaken it is essential to ensure that the roof and walls are made waterandweathertight and the structure is checked for stability it appears that the roof trusses may need repairs and additional bracing ideally the roof should be replaced with an outer material in keeping with the character and location of the barn this would also allow for a wellinsulated inner skin to be provided which should be light coloured it is likely that the most efficient way of heating the building is with electricity in order to provide this the owner will need to have an electrical engineer calculate the potential heating power and lighting load to make sure the mains supply and distribution capacity are adequate ideally it would be good to have a mains water supply and some means of drainage for toilet and washing facilities the walls should be dry lined with a single skin of plasterboard laid over rockwool slab which will allow good wall insulation and the power and lighting circuits to be concealed and the walls should be painted in a light colour the owner mentions she might lay a new floor over the existing planks this will improve the insulation and offer a level surface i would suggest laying new oak veneer planks which can work in with the character of the barn as for lighting consider a combination of floor mounted uplights wall lights wall washers and selected downlights use a combination of mains voltage fluorescent fittings and dimmable units which can vary the light levels and the feel of the interior please click on the link to the right here to see my ideas for mariannes barn the layout of this office reflects the need to have a working area and a more relaxed meeting space large desk space and extensive storage would combine with tub chairs to maximise the space available the finishes chosen for the furniture will need to reflect the unusual setting while the lighting and temperature control mechanisms used will further influence the workplace regarding accessing the internet via the connection in the main house your plan of going wireless is sensible a wireless routeraccess point in the house with a wireless lan card in the pc in the renovated area may be sufficient however important points to consider are the distance between the two buildings and the nature of the materials through which the signals have to pass which could result in a weak signal strength you may require an additional wireless access point in the renovated area your local it supplier will be able to advise on this if you havent already invested in robust firewall and antivirus software it is essential to do so to protect your investment to really take advantage of wireless technology you might consider a laptop computer and a docking station with external mouse and monitor or you could

to an unambiguous tale of woe the ship had another slice of bad luck to add to its history of health scares and technical trouble and its owner po cruises now part of the huge us carnival corporation was looking at a significant slice chopped off this years profits and a potential pr fiasco noone however seems to have told the stock markets the warning of a fivecent hit to earnings came just hours after one of the worlds biggest investment banks had upped its target for carnivals share price from to other investors barely blinked and by gmt carnivals shares in london were down a single penny or at why the mismatch between the public perception and the markets response the aurora issue had been an ongoing one for some time says deutsche banks simon champion it was clearly a source of uncertainty for the company it was a long cruise after all but the stock market is very good at treating these issues as oneoff events despite its string of bad luck he pointed out aurora is just one vessel in a large carnival fleet the uks po princess group having been merged into the much larger us firm in and generally speaking carnival has a reputation for keeping its ships pretty much on schedule carnival has an incredibly strong track record mr champion similarly analysts expect the impact on the rest of the cruise business to be limited the hundreds of disappointed passengers who have now had to give up the opportunity to spend the next three months on the aurora have got both a refund and a credit for another cruise that should mitigate some of the pr risk both for carnival and its main competitor royal caribbean while not common cancellations for technical reasons are not entirely unusual in the industry wrote analysts from citigroup smith barney in a note to clients on friday moreover such events typically have a limited impact on bookings and pricing for future cruises after all the aurora incident may be big news in the uk but for carnival customers elsewhere its unlikely to make too much of a splash assuming that citigroup is right and demand stays solid the structure of the industry also works in carnivals favour in the wake of po princesss takeover by carnival the business is now to a great extent a duopoly given the expense of building outfitting and running a cruise ship slowing supply growth is a certainty said david anders at merrill lynch on thursday in other words if you do want a cruise your options are limited and with carnival remaining the market leader it looks set to keep selling the tickets no matter what happens to the illfated aurora in the future the ticking budget facing the us the budget proposals laid out by the administration of us president george w bush are highly controversial the washingtonbased economic policy institute which tends to be critical of the president looks at possible fault lines us politicians and citizens of all political persuasions are in for a dose of shock therapy without major changes in current policies and political prejudices the federal budget simply cannot hold together news coverage of the bush budget will be dominated by debates about spending cuts but the fact is these will be large cuts in small programs from the standpoint of the big fiscal trends the cuts are gratuitous and the big budget train wreck is yet to come under direct threat will be the federal governments ability to make good on its debts to the social security trust fund as soon as the fund will begin to require some cash returns on its bond holdings in order to finance all promised benefits the trigger for the coming shock will be rising federal debt which will grow in years by conservative estimates to more than half the nations total annual output this upward trend will force increased borrowing by the federal government putting upward pressure on interest rates faced by consumers and business even now a growing share of us borrowing is from abroad the us government cannot finance its operations without heavy borrowing from the central banks of japan and china among other nations this does not bode well for us influence in the world the decline of the dollar is a warning sign that current economic trends cannot continue the dollar is already sinking before too long credit markets are likely to react and interest rates will creep upwards that will be the shock interestsensitive industries will feel pain immediately sectors such as housing automobiles other consumer durables agriculture and small business some will recall the news footage of angry farmers driving their heavy equipment around the us capitol in the late s there will be no need for constitutional amendments to balance the budget the public outcry will force congress to act whether it will act wisely is another matter how did this happen by definition the deficit means too little revenue and too much spending but this neutral description doesnt adequately capture the current situation federal revenues are at s levels while spending remains where it has been in recent decades much higher in addition the united states has two significant military missions the bush administrations chosen remedy is the least feasible one reducing domestic spending or eliminating waste fraud and abuse is toothless because this slice of the budget is too small to solve the problem indeed if congress were rash enough to balance the budget in this way there would hardly be any such spending left law enforcement space exploration environmental cleanup economic development the small business administration housing veterans benefits aid to state and local governments would all but disappear its fantasy to think these routine government functions could be slashed the biggest spending growth areas are defence including homeland security and health care for the elderly and the poor to some extent increases in these areas are inevitable the us population is aging and the nation does face genuine threats in the world but serious savings can only be found where the big money is savings in health care spending that do not come at the expense of health can only be achieved with wholesale reform of the entire system public and private brute force budget cuts or spending caps would illserve the nations elderly and indigent on the revenue side the lions share of revenue lost to tax cuts enacted since will have to be replaced some rearranging could hold many people harmless and focus most of the pain on those with relatively high incomes finally blind allegiance to a balanced budget will have to be abandoned there is no good reason to fixate on it anyway moderate deficits and slowly rising federal debt can be sustained indefinitely borrowing for investments in education and infrastructure that pay off in future years makes sense the sooner we face that reality the sooner workable reforms can be pursued first on the list should be tax reform to raise revenue simplify the tax code and restore some fairness eroded by the bush tax cuts second should be a dispassionate reevaluation of the huge increase in defence spending over the past three years much of it unrelated to afghanistan iraq or terrorism third must be the start of a serious debate on largescale health care reform one thing is certain destroying the budget in order to save it is not going to equip the us economy and government for the challenges of this new century ebbers aware of worldcom fraud former worldcom boss bernie ebbers was directly involved in the bn financial fraud at the firm his closest associate has told a us court giving evidence in the criminal trial of mr ebbers exfinance chief scott sullivan implicated his colleague in the accounting scandal at the firm mr sullivan worldcoms former number two is the governments chief witness in its case against mr ebbers mr ebbers has denied multiple charges of conspiracy and fraud senior worldcom executives are accused of orchestrating a huge fraud at the former telecoms company in which they exaggerated revenues and hid the cost of expenses the firm was forced into bankruptcy the largest in us history mr sullivan pleaded guilty to fraud last year and agreed to assist the government with its case against mr ebbers prosecutors have alleged that mr ebbers directed mr sullivan to hide the true state of the companys finances by providing false information to the firms accountants mr ebbers has denied all the charges saying he was unaware of the fraud his lawyers claim that their client was unfamiliar with detailed accounting practices and left that side of the business to mr sullivan however on monday mr sullivan named mr ebbers as one of five executives who participated in the accounting fraud he ebbers has got a handson grasp of financial information mr sullivan told a new york court on his first day of questioning mr sullivan admitted to falsifying the companys financial statements we did not disclose these adjustments he said we did not talk about these adjustments and the information was false mr sullivan said his former boss knew more about accounting matters than many chief financial officers and described him as detailoriented he portrayed mr ebbers a charismatic businessman who built up worldcom from a small regional operator into one of americas largest telecoms firms as obsessed with costs he would talk about that there were more coffee filters than coffee bags and that means employees are taking coffee home he said we needed to cut expenses we needed to cut a lot more than coffee expenses mr sullivan is at the centre of the governments case against mr ebbers mr ebbers could face a sentence of years if convicted of all the charges he is facing renault boss hails great year

dell but investors have been less than impressed with lenovos move designed to take it out of china and further onto the world stage its shares are down since the announcement two months ago largely

nonfarm payrolls was below market expectations of new jobs nevertheless it was enough to push down the unemployment rate to its lowest level since september the job gains mean that president bush can celebrate albeit by a very fine margin a net growth in jobs in the us economy in his first term in office he presided over a net fall in jobs up to last novembers presidential election the first

office in the maldives the cost of reconstruction could wipe out economic growth according to a government spokesman our nation is in peril here said ahmed shaheed the chief government spokesman he estimated the economic cost of the disaster at hundreds of millions of dollars the maldives has gross domestic product of m it wont be surprising if the cost exceeds our gdp he said in the last few

resort the economic mainstay could run to m between and of the odd resorts have been severely damaged and a similar number have suffered significant damage however many experts including the world bank have pointed out that it is still difficult to assess the magnitude of the disaster and its likely economic impact in part this is because of its scale and because delivering aid and recovering the dead remain priorities calculators will have to wait said an imf official in a briefing on wednesday the financial and world community will be turning toward reconstruction efforts and at that point people will begin to have a sense of the financial impact booming markets shed few tears the market former british government minister michael heseltine once said has no morality and indeed stock exchange traders around asia have wasted little time regretting the victims of this weeks disaster stock markets in indonesia and india have hit alltime highs this week even in sri lanka more comprehensively affected the main index has lost only since the waves hit bigger markets further afield have barely twitched the msci world share index a measure of global stock market performance hit its highest level this week since early the bbc global has risen by in the past week and this at a time when all sentiment aside insurance costs are already estimated in the tens of billions of dollars and countries around the region are looking at trimming their growth forecasts in fact the markets are being perfectly rational for a start the notional insurance cost of the disaster will have little bearing on corporate bottom lines the overwhelming majority of the victims will have had no insurance according to estimates from india only onequarter of those affected there were wealthy enough to afford insurance and only onequarter of that group at most will have taken out policies indonesia is likely to have even lower takeup rates and where insurance certainly is in place in for example the many tourist complexes affected the costs will be borne in faraway corners of the global reinsurance market rather than landing locally second stock markets do not trade the sort of companies likely to have been damaged most of the biggest companies traded on the soaring jakarta stock exchange are in oil technology and financial services none of which have been hit by the flooding tourist businesses the most likely sufferers are either foreignowned or too small to have their shares listed those that are listed have suffered confifi hotel holdings a small sri lankan tourism firm has halved in value this week but there are winners as well as losers asian stock markets are heavily inclined towards property and construction companies many of which will be rubbing their hands over the reconstruction opportunities in indonesia shares in state construction companies adhi karya and semen gresik have jumped sharply this week more broadly the academic consensus is that major disasters are largely neutral in their longerterm economic impact according to the natural hazards research and applications information center at colorado state university there is little evidence that disasters are inevitably followed by a depression the need to find money to replace lost and damaged property is balanced by the beneficial effect of reconstruction activity there is rarely the centre says any sort of rebuilding boom but in most cases sizeable indirect losses are avoided a study of the des moines floods from the disaster research center at the university of delaware found that of local businesses were no worse off after the disaster and another felt themselves better off although it is commonly assumed on the basis of anecdotal evidence that disasters result in business failures and bankruptcies on a large scale our research indicates that most businesses even those that are especially hardhit do indeed recover the authors concluded but disasters have a vast psychological impact and markets are driven by psychological factors in particular many analysts warn of panic spreading unchecked through the global financial system as investors seek to cover themselves against the unforeseeable effects of unguessable events in fact again the risks here are lower than they seem even the costliest natural disaster is rendered minuscule by the global capital market currently trillion and rising a series of recent shocks the colorado centre has argued have demonstrated that this seamless global contagion hardly ever happens market tremors rarely translate into economic slumps and economic woes rarely seriously undermine markets the trilliondollar debts of japans banks for example have had no effect on stock markets further afield than tokyo and the us stock market was on its way down long before september it rose by during the six months following the attacks it is not that the broking community is indifferent to disasters or feelings

both fell as the market speculated about the cost of rebuilding in asia zurich financial allianz and axa also suffered a decline in value however their losses were much smaller reflecting the markets

industry specific with the travel and insurance firms hit hardest its still too early for concrete damage figures swiss res spokesman floiran woest told associated press that also has to do with the fact that the damage is very widely spread geographically the unfolding scale of the disaster in south asia had little immediate impact on us shares however the dow jones index had risen points or to

marsh under sec scrutiny the us stock market regulator is investigating troubled insurance broker marsh mclennans shareholder transactions the firm has said the securities and exchange commission has asked for information about transactions involving holders of or more of the firms shares marsh has said it is cooperating fully with the sec investigation marsh is also the focus of an inquiry the new york attorneygeneral into whether insurers rigged the market since that inquiry was launched in october marsh has replaced its chief executive and held a boardroom shakeout to meet criticism by lessening the number of company executives on the board prosecutors allege that marsh the worlds biggest insurance broker and other us insurance firms may have fixed bids for corporate cover this is the issue at the heart of the inquiry by new yorks top law officer eliot spitzer and a separate prosecution of five insurers by the state of california the secs investigation into socalled related party transactions includes dealings in the trident funds managed by mmc capital the companys private equity firm marshs new chief executive michael cherkasky is trying to negotiate a settlement with mr spitzer mr spitzer has built up a reputation as a fierce critic and campaigner against corporate americas misdeeds the uncertainty unleashed by the scandal has prompted three credit rating agencies standard poors moodys and fitch to downgrade marsh in recent weeks according to the financial times insurance analysts are now questioning whether marsh will be able to maintain its strong record of earning growth as they draw up forecasts for the first quarter of next year doubts also exist over how much the company may have to pay regulators and lawyers to put the scandal behind could yukos be a blessing in disguise other things being equal the notion of entrepreneurs languishing in jail while their companies are sold off for a song ought to be bad for business but in the lookingglass world of modern russia the opposite might just be true a new report has argued the study from the centre for economic policy research does not praise the rough handling of oil company yukos but it argues that more rigorous tax policing has benefited all russian firms even targets of the tax police an increase in tax enforcement can increase the amount of dividends and other income outside shareholders will receive even accounting for increased levels of taxation the authors say the papers reasoning is complex and is based on a sophisticated model of the relationship between tax regimes and corporate governance in particular the propensity of management to steal from the company the calculations demonstrated what many russian analysts already knew that increasing the tax rate increases the amount that managers steal since undeclared income becomes relatively more valuable in the west meanwhile higher tax rates translate far more smoothly into higher government revenues on the other hand increasing the rigour with which taxes are collected encourages companies to become more transparent forcing them to be able to demonstrate their financial position far more accurately the net result the authors say is that the extra amount companies pay in tax is more than compensated for by greater efficiency and financial soundness after vladimir putin became president in he did not raise taxes but put a lot of effort too much critics argue into enforcement since then the russian stock market has more than trebled in value a rise the authors attribute at least in part to the newly tough approach the report highlights the case of sibneft a russian oil company that came close to merging with yukos last year after mr putin came to power the companys overall effective tax rate rose from to and sibneft was the target of a series of aggressive raids by fiscal police but shareholders benefited hugely sibneft started to pay dividends m in and almost bn in and closed down the network of opaque subsidiaries it had previously used for siphoning off unofficial funds according to the authors although a variety of changes were sweeping through russian industry at the time the increase in tax enforcement is the only likely explanation for the change of fortunes at sibneft and many of its peers does this analysis make sense in part certainly for all its faults corporate russia has become far more orderly and lawabiding since companies have rushed to list their shares on international stock exchanges something unthinkable in the wilder days of the s and most large firms now produce their accounts to international standards foreign direct investment long negligible is starting to flow in serious amounts bn in and stock market returns have been among the healthiest in europe but the authors model does not quite cover all the complexities for a start the model assumes that the various parties have clearlydefined motivation companies want to maximise profit governments want to maximise tax revenue in fact the alarmingly close connections between big business and government in russia connections often greased by bribery blur the apparently antagonistic relationship companies can for example persuade officials to overlook nonpayment of taxes and the authors definition of tax enforcement seems unrealistically western genuine disinterested tax collection might well work wonders in russia the problem with recent examples has been the erratic and unpredictable way laws are enforced the case against yukos for example has moved in fits and starts with little clarity from the government about its intentions and little faith from investors that the letter of the law would be followed as far as most commentators are concerned the state is pursuing yukos out of a political vendetta rather than simply to enforce fiscal rectitude since yukos founder mikhail khodorkovsky was arrested a year ago the russian market has dropped by an

equity strategist naoki kamiyama the optimism in the financial markets contrast sharply with pessimism in the japanese business community earlier this month the quarterly tankan survey of japanese manufacturers found that business confidence had weakened for the first time since march slower economic growth rising oil prices a stronger yen and weaker exports were blamed for the fall in confidence despite this traders expect strength in the global economy to benefit japan which has been close to sliding into recession in recent months structural reform within japan and an anticipated end to the banking sectors bad debt problems should also help they say eu too slow on economic reforms most eu countries have failed to put in place policies aimed at making europe the worlds most competitive economy by the end of the decade a report says the study undertaken by the european commission sought to assess how far the eu has moved towards meeting its economic targets in eu leaders at a summit in lisbon pledged the european economy would outstrip that of the us by their economic targets became known as the lisbon agenda but the commission report says that in most eu countries the pace of economic reform has been too slow and fulfilling the lisbon ambitions will be difficult if not impossible only the uk finland belgium denmark ireland and the netherlands have actually followed up policy recommendations among the biggest laggards according to the report are greece and italy the lisbon agenda set out to increase the number of people employed in europe by encouraging more older people and women to stay in the workforce it also set out to raise the amount the private sector spends on research and development while bringing about greater discipline over public spending and debt levels combined with high environmental standards and efforts to level the playing field for businesses throughout the eu the plan was for europe to become the worlds most dynamic economy by next week the commission will present revised proposals to meet the lisbon goals many people expect the target to be quietly dropped japans ageing workforce built to last in his twenties he battled tuberculosis for eight years then went on to run his own clothing business before marrying in his late thirties and the yearold torao toshitsune has eaten raw fish pretty much every day throughout his life mr toshitsune is one of japans centenarians a club that is growing by annually and where the oldest member is at his neat osaka detached house where he lives with one of his sexagenarian daughters mr toshitsune keeps a regular routine of copying out buddhist sutras and preparing the traditional japanese tea ceremony between tasks this remarkably active senior citizen reveals what his next goal is well whats most important for me is to be japans number one mr toshitsune wants to outlive everyone and when it comes to longevity japan as a country appears to be doing just that women can expect to live until men until four years longer than americans and europeans on the outskirts of kyoto yearold yuji shimizu contemplates this phenomenon during a round of golf with his younger friends who are in their seventies i think this is because the food industry and the environment have improved he remarks on average we can live longer whether its the diet or the traditional family structure where roles were clearly defined or just something in the genes japans elderly are remarkable but while life may be a game of golf for mr shimizu his grandchildren have huge problems ahead japan is the worlds least fertile nation with childbirth rates of just two thirds of that in the us by japans population is expected to peak at million then shrink to under million by the middle of the century this means million fewer workers at a time when the number of elderly will have almost doubled in the year if the birth rate remains the same people over will make up over of the population explains shigeo morioka of the international longevity centre in tokyo so how will japans finances stay on track after a decade of economic stagnation and huge deficit spending the public sector debt is already about of the countrys gross domestic product gdp the highest rate among industrialised countries the international monetary fund predicts that as the falling birth rate takes grip from the cost of running japans welfare state will double to more than of gdp while current account balances will deteriorate by over but unfortunately japan appears poorly prepared both financially and politically glen wood vice president of deutsche securities japan asks whos going to fund the pension fund for the next generation and indeed who are going to be the new japanese worker who is going to build the economy who are going to be the leaders who are going to be the producers of the gdp going forward one option is further welfare reform another is immigration possibly from the philippines and indonesia but so far any emerging policy appears restricted to a limited number of nursing staff standing next to tokyo harbour is a version of new yorks statue of liberty but as yet japan is not ready for an ellis island japan has never really liked that option in its history and i think its an option thats becoming more and more plausible and necessary insists mr wood in japan as in europe which also faces a workforce decline immigration is a very sensitive subject but for the japanese economy facing fewer consumers by means slumping domestic sales of cars hitech kit and home appliances perhaps even another property crash of course the japanese could always have more children the government is currently considering financial rewards for procreative couples similar to those in operation in australia but there would be no pay back until when todays babies are taxpayers and the demographic crisis like in europe starts to unfold in in contrast to japan and of course the european union the us population is expected to increase by to million by the middle of the century although president bush must redevise social security to take account of a rise in americas over s the imf foresees a positive contribution to the us current account balance from the combined forces of fertility and immigration some voices in japanese industry are calling for radical changes to the nature of the japanese labour market they want a shift towards financial services though doubts persist over the countrys ability let alone willingness to move away from manufacturing japan still has problems getting a viable banking system let alone shifting their auto business or their semiconductor business or the broad based tech manufacturing business overseas says mr wood japan can either drive some radical reforms or else run the risk of a vicious ageing recession falling demand and a lower tax take could result in soaring budget pressures and a basket case currency come japan could be more dependent on a shrinking workforce than any other industrialised power there are fears that the worlds number two economy is doomed to a permanent recession but none of this is mr toshitsunes concern anymore at he chuckles that he feels fine uk economy facing major risks the uk manufacturing sector will continue to face serious challenges over the next two years the british chamber of commerce bcc has said the groups quarterly survey of companies found exports had picked up in the last three months of to their best levels in eight years the rise came despite exchange rates being cited as a major concern however the bcc found the whole uk economy still faced major risks and warned that growth is set to slow it recently forecast economic growth will slow from more than in to a little below in both and manufacturers domestic sales growth fell back slightly in the quarter the survey of firms found employment in manufacturing also fell and job expectations were at their lowest level for a year despite some positive news for the export sector there are worrying signs for manufacturing the bcc said these results reinforce our concern over the sectors persistent inability to sustain recovery the outlook for the service sector was uncertain despite an increase in exports and orders over the quarter the bcc noted the bcc found confidence increased in the quarter across both the manufacturing and service sectors although overall it failed to reach the levels at the start of the reduced threat of interest rate increases had contributed to improved confidence it said the bank of england raised interest rates five times between november and august last year but rates have been kept on hold since then amid signs of falling consumer confidence and a slowdown in output the pressure on costs and margins the relentless increase in regulations and the threat of higher taxes remain serious problems bcc director general david frost said while consumer spending is set to decelerate significantly over the next months it is unlikely that investment and exports will rise sufficiently strongly to pick up the slack bank holds interest rate at the bank of england has left interest rates on hold again at in a widelypredicted move rates went up five times from november as the bank sought to cool the housing market and consumer debt but have remained unchanged since august recent data has indicated a slowdown in manufacturing and consumer spending as well as in mortgage approvals and retail sales disappointed over christmas with analysts putting the drop down to less consumer confidence rising interest rates and the accompanying slowdown in the housing market have knocked consumers optimism causing a sharp fall in demand for expensive goods according to a report earlier this week from the british retail consortium the brc said britains retailers had endured their worst christmas in a decade todays no change decision is correct said david frost director general of the british chambers of commerce bcc but if there are clear signs that the economy slows the mpc should be ready to take quick corrective action and cut rates dismal reports from the retail trade about christmas sales are worrying if they indicate a more general weakening in consumer spending mr frost added the housing market outlook remains highly uncertain it is widely accepted that if house prices start falling more sharply the risks facing the economy will worsen considerably cbi chief economist ian mccafferty said the economy had slowed in recent months in response to rate rises but that it was difficult to gauge from the christmas period the likely pace of activity through the summer the bank is having to juggle the emergence of inflationary pressures driven by a tight labour market and buoyant commodity prices against the risk of an overabrupt slowdown in consumer activity he said interest rates are likely to remain on hold for some time on thursday there was more gloomy news on the manufacturing front as the office for national ons statistics revealed british manufacturing output unexpectedly fell in november for the fifth month in the past six the ons said manufacturing output dropped in november matching a similar unrevised fall in october and confounding economists expectations of a rise manufacturers organisation the eef said it expected the hold in interest rates to continue in the near future it also said there was evidence that manufacturers confidence may be waning as the outlook for the world economy becomes more uncertain so far the evidence suggests that last years rate increases have helped to rebalance the economy without damaging the recovery in manufacturing said eef chief economist steve radley however should the business outlook start to deteriorate the bank should stand ready to cut rates some economists have predicted rates will drop later in the year although others feel the bank may still think there is a need for a rise to before that happens the bank remains concerned about the longterm risks posed by personal debt which is rising at a year if economic conditions worsen tobacco giants hail court ruling us tobacco companies have welcomed an appeal courts decision to reject the governments bn bn claim for alleged deceit about smoking dangers tobacco stocks rose sharply on wall street after the decision the court in washington found the case filed by the clinton administration in could not be brought under federal antiracketeering laws antismoking groups urge the government to fight on but the justice department has not said if it will appeal among the accused were altria group rj reynolds tobacco lorillard tobacco liggett group and brown and williamson they were delighted by the decision which sent reynolds shares up and altria shares up charles a blixt executive vicepresident of rj reynolds tobacco said the ruling dramatically transforms the governments lawsuit altria group said in a statement the government now must not only prove that the companies have engaged in fraudulent behaviour in the past but that they are likely to do so in the future the government had claimed tobacco firms manipulated nicotine levels to increase addiction targeted teenagers with multibillion dollar advertising campaigns lied about the dangers of smoking and ignored research to the contrary prosecutors wanted the cigarette firms to disgorge bn in profits accumulated over the past years and impose tougher rules on marketing their products they brought the case under racketeering laws which were passed to deny mafia gangs the profits of their crimes but the tobacco companies denied that they illegally conspired to promote smoking and defraud the public they also said they had already met many of the governments demands in a landmark bn settlement reached with states in the threejudge panel in the district of columbias court of appeals ruled on friday that the us government could not sue the firms under the antiracketeering laws judge david sentelle in his ruling said such laws were aimed at putting an end to illegal conduct going forward we hold that the language of the law and the comprehensive remedial scheme of the law preclude disgorgement as a possible remedy in this case he wrote the justice department refused to say if it would appeal all were saying today is that we have received the ruling and are reviewing it a spokeswoman said on friday but william corr of the campaign for tobaccofree kids urged the government to continue pressing its case todays ruling should not be an excuse for this administration to seek a weak settlement that lets the tobacco industry off the hook he said steady job growth continues in us the us created fewer jobs than expected in december but analysts said that the dip in hiring was not enough to derail the worlds biggest economy according to labor department figures new jobs were added last month that took s total to million the best showing in five years job creation was one of last years main concerns for the us economy while worries still remain the conditions are set for steady growth in analysts said the unemployment rate stayed at in december and about jobs will need to be created each month if that figure is to drop it was a respectable report said michael moran analyst at daiwa securities payroll growth in december was a little lighter than the consensus forecast but we had upward revisions to the prior two months and an increase in manufacturing employment manufacturing is a cyclical area of the economy and if its showing job growth its a good indication that the economy is on a solid growth track that means that the federal reserve is likely to continue its policy of raising interest rates the fed lifted borrowing costs five times last year to citing evidence the us economic recovery was becoming more robust job creation was one of last years main concerns for the us economy and proved to be a main topic of debate in the us presidential election while demand for workers is far from booming the conditions are set for steady growth overall compared to the previous year it looks great it just keeps going stronger and stronger and i expect that to be the case in said kurt karl economist at swiss re in new york meanwhile economists cautioned against reading too much into data from the federal reserve showing an unexpected bn drop in consumer debt in november a fall in consumer spending which makes up about twothirds of all us economic activity could help limit the extent of any future interest rate rises but economists said there could be a number of reasons for a fall in the borrowing which include credit cards and personal loans while noting that such figures can vary on a monthtomonth basis wall street cheers bush victory the us stock market has closed higher in response to george w bushs victory in the presidential elections the benchmark dow jones share index closed more than higher at while the nasdaq rose to many investors believe that mr bushs policies are more businessfriendly than those of his democrat challenger john kerry the higher share prices also reflect relief that a clear winner has emerged from what proved to be a tight poll investors had worried that the outcome of the poll would be inconclusive paving the way for a repeat of the legal wrangling that marred the election the dow lost of its value in the three weeks immediately after that election when it was unclear who would occupy the white house mr kerry conceded defeat on wednesday abandoning lastditch hopes of carrying the vote in the swing state of ohio the relief for the markets may be that we have a decision and can move forward said tim ghriskey chief investment officer of solaris asset management some analysts predicted that the jump in share prices would be shortlived saying investors would quickly focus once again on the health of the us economy i would look at the stock market rally for bush as kind of a oneday event said ken mayland at clearview economics the us recent economic performance has been mixed with solid growth offset by disappointingly low job creation figures and mounting worries over a record budget deficit elsewhere in the financial markets on wednesday the dollar dipped slightly against the euro and climbed against the yen while us oil prices closed up at a barrel in new york the rise in oil prices partly reflects the view that president bush is less likely than mr kerry to release supplies from the us strategic oil reserve share prices in london frankfurt and paris also closed higher successive polls in the runup to tuesdays election had shown the two candidates running neck and neck economic issues as well as the war in iraq were the forefront of the campaign in key swing states such as ohio which has suffered substantial job losses in the past four years president bushs handling of the economy became a crucial election issue senator kerry attacked president bushs economic record during his campaign hammering home the fact that a net jobs were lost during his term in office president bush focused on the fact that two million jobs have been created in the past year claiming that it has vindicated his taxcutting agenda as for future policies both candidates pledged to bring americas bn federal budget deficit under control senator kerry planned to increase taxes on those earning more than a year president bush has placed reform of the pensions system at the heart of his economic agenda for a second term however economists have said both candidates economic programmes rested on questionable assumptions about future growth business confidence dips in japan business confidence among japanese manufacturers has weakened for the first time since march the quarterly tankan survey has found slower economic growth rising oil prices a stronger yen and weaker exports were blamed for the fall decembers confidence level was below that seen in september the bank of japan said however septembers reading was the strongest for years the economy is at a pause but unlikely to fall the economy minister said it will feel a bit slower next year than this year and growth may be a bit more gentle but the situation is that the recovery will continue said economy minister heizo takenaka in the bank of japans december survey the balance of big manufacturers saying business conditions are better minus those saying they are worse was down from in september japans economy grew by just in the three months to september according revised data issued this month with the recovery slowing the worlds second biggest economy is now expected grow by in the tankan index is based on a survey of firms big manufacturers were even more pessimistic about the first quarter of their views suggest the march reading could go as low as still in positive territory but weaker the dollars decline has strengthened the yen making japanese exports more expensive in the us chinas attempts to cool down its fastgrowing economy have also hit japanese industrys sales abroad confidence among nonmanufacturers was unchanged in the final quarter of but it is forecast to drop one point in the march survey nonetheless japanese firms have been stepping up capital investment and the survey found the pace is quickening companies reported they expect to invest more in the year to march than the previous year up from expectations of increase in the september tankan millions to lose textile jobs millions of the worlds poorest textile trade workers will lose their jobs under new trade rules to be introduced in the new year a charity has warned the world trade organisation wto is to end its multifibre agreement mfa on midnight of december christian aid condemned the move saying it would see almost a million jobs in bangladesh alone being axed however supporters of the change claim it will mean increased efficiency and lower costs for western consumers it will also see more jobs created in india and china advocates argue the wto said that many developing countries support the end of quotas and stressed that funding was available to countries such as bangladesh to help them make the transition to a fully liberalised market there will be a period of adjustment required said wto spokesman keith rockwell some countries will do better than others but there is no one who is suggesting that no developing country will do well out of this some countries where it may appear that orders will dry up have seen orders surging and there are many companies who will continue with existing trading relationships christian aid has called on british firms not to simply cut and run but look after their workers in a new report called rags to riches to rags it added that with few employment alternatives available many sacked garment workers could end up in far worse jobs with some of the mainly female workers forced into the sex trade the wto itself has warned that as many as million jobs could be lost as a result of liberalisation in the textile industry some of the worlds fastest developing countries which rely on textile exports to build growth for example in bangladesh textiles account for almost of the countrys exports and the industry employs around million people the mfa pact has helped developing countries get a bigger share of the world market the losers in this new trade landscape will be some of the most vulnerable workers in countries such as bangladesh cambodia sri lanka and nepal andrew pendleton christian aids head of trade policy said they will be hardpressed to cope when garment industries there lose their protection we are deeply concerned that the new year will spell misery for huge numbers of garment workers the wto said there was no consenus among its members to retain the quotas and emphasised that funding was available to countries such as bangladesh to help them adjust to the liberalised market it added that the impact of the changes for workers most affected by the shakeup had not been considered adding such seismic changes to policy should put the interests of poor people first rather than simply aiming to liberalise markets at any cost while the current mfa was not perfect its did allow third world countries like bangladesh to get onto the first rung of industrial development christian aid said international trade must not be governed by a race to the bottom that pitches one set of poor people against another mr pendleton added dutch bank to lay off staff abn amro the netherlands largest bank is to cut jobs as a result of falling profits the cuts amounting to of the banks workforce will result in a oneoff charge of m euros bn about jobs will go in investment banking while and will go in it and human resources respectively abn amro is the third large european bank to announce cutbacks in the past month following deutsche bank and credit suisse group its profitability has been hit by a fall in mortgage lending in the united states the banks largest single market following recent interest rate rises abn amros operations in the netherlands and the united kingdom will be hardest hit jobs will also be lost in the us which accounted for of profit in the first half of and across its operations in the americas and asiapacific regions the restructuring is designed to improve efficiency by reducing administrative costs and increasing focus on client service the bank said it was on course for a rise in net income this year but operating profits are set to fall because of a fall in us revenues abn amro currently has more than staff to get any profit growth in the coming years they will have to lower costs so shedding jobs makes total sense ivo geijsen an analyst with bank oyens van eeghen told bloomberg europes leading banks seem set for a period of retrenchment deutsche bank said earlier this month it would reduce its german workforce by while as many as jobs will be lost at credit suisse first boston fannie mae should restate books us mortgage company fannie mae should restate its earnings a move that is likely to put a billiondollar dent in its accounts watchdogs have said the securities exchange commission accused fannie mae of using techniques that did not comply in material respects with accounting standards fannie mae last month warned that some records were incorrect the other main us mortgage firm freddie mac restated earnings by bn bn last year after a probe of its books the secs comments are likely to increase pressure on congress to strengthen supervision of fannie mae and freddie mac the two firms are key parts of the us financial system and effectively underwrite the mortgage market financing nearly half of all american house purchases and dealing actively in bonds and other financial instruments the investigation of freddie mac in june sparked concerns about the wider health of the industry and raised questionsmarks over the role of the office of federal housing enterprise oversight ofheo the industrys main regulator having been pricked into action the ofheo turned its attention to fannie may and in september this year said that the firm had tweaked its books to spread earnings more smoothly across quarters and play down the amount of risk it had taken on the sec found similar problems the watchdogs chief accountant donald nicolaisen said that fannie maes methodology of assessing measuring and documenting hedge ineffectiveness was inadequate and was not supported by generally accepted accounting principles jj agrees bn guidant deal pharmaceutical giant johnson johnson has agreed to buy medical technology firm guidant for bn bn guidant is a key producer of equipment that combats heart problems such as implant defibrillators and pacemakers analysts said that the deal is aimed at offsetting johnson johnsons reliance on a slowing drug business they also pointed out that more mergers are likely because the drug and healthcare industries are fragmented and are under pressure to cut costs a number of johnson johnsons products are facing patent expirations while the company is also battling fierce competition from generic products meanwhile demand for defibrillators which give the heart a small electric shock when an irregular heartbeat or rhythm is detected is expected to increase analysts said the move by johnson johnson has been widely expected

airline brazils airport authority chief carlos wilson had claimed the government was on the brink of stepping in to save varig brazils flagship airline however the countrys vice president jose alencar has said the government still is looking for a solution varig is struggling under a huge debt burden of an estimated debt of billion reais bn or bn asked whether a rescue was on the cards following a meeting of the countrys congress to discuss the airlines crisis mr alencar replied no i dont think so we will see earlier mr wilson had said that president luiz inacio lula da silva has decided to step in and a decree of some kind of intervention could be signed this week in practice it will be an intervention although this is not the technical name used he said an intervention means that the government would take administrative control of the company and its finances for that to happen varigs main shareholder the nonprofit ruben berta foundation which represents the airlines employees would have to be removed mr wilson said however no jobs would be lost and the airline would keep on flying he added varig which operates in countries apart from brazil has been driven to the brink of collapse because of the countrys economic downturn the depreciation of brazils currency has had a direct impact on the airlines dollar debt as well as some of its costs business has improved recently

president left the company amid an ongoing restructuring laurent beaudoin part of the family that controls the montrealbased firm will take on the role of ceo under a newly created management

brazils bankruptcy laws has been approved by the countrys congress in a move which it is hoped will cut the cost of borrowing the bill proposed in has finally been approved by the leadership of president luiz inacio lula da silva the old law dating from gave priority first to workers second to tax revenue and finally to creditors the new legislation changes this giving priority to creditors and limiting payments to workers the new regulations will limit payments to workers to times the minimum monthly salary which is currently the law also makes it more difficult for a company to declare bankruptcy however when a firm is declared bankrupt it will gain protection from creditors for days while a recovery plan is worked out the proposals were opposed in the past by leftist parties including mr lulas worker party they considered that they undermined workers rights but president lula became a defender of the reforms arguing that the countrys bank lending margins were among the highest in the world and were damaging the economy according to andreas adriano of latin trade magazine the new bankruptcy law will help in reducing the spread difference between the interest rates of the banks and federal bonds nevertheless mr adriano said to reduce the basic interest rate the central bank needs to change its policy focusing not only on inflation but also on economic growth cairn shares slump on oil setback shares in cairn energy a uk oil firm have closed down after a disappointing drilling update and a warning over possible tax demands the company said tests had shown no significant finds in one of its indian oil fields but was upbeat about the potential of other areas it also said the indian government had told it to pay a production tax for which cairn argues it is not liable cairns shares have jumped by almost this year investors had piled into cairn after the company announced significant oil finds in india this year chief executive bill gammell said on friday he was disappointed with exploration in the socalled nc extension area in rajasthan investors had held high hopes of major oil finds in this area but cairn said estimates had been revised in what was a significant downgrade of the initial expectation cairn also said that the government believed the company was liable to pay taxes under its productionsharing contract the company said the rate would be about rupees per tonne or seven barrels of oil a spokesman for the firm said that the tax would wipe of the fields current value cairn refutes the governments position mr gammell said he insisted that the contract made it clear that the tax should be shouldered by the licensee indias staterun oil natural gas corp ongc and not the contractor we have a pretty strong legal case here he added saying it would only become an issue once the firm started production investors took a dim view of the statements though the shares closed down p or at pence i think people were slightly overambitious for how quickly cairn would be able to develop and potentially offload these reserves said analyst jason kenney at ing the disappointments overshadowed increased production targets for cairns existing oilfields the company raised targets for its mangala and aishwariya fields in india from barrels a day to between and barrels a day its mangala field thought to contain a billion barrels is its biggest find to date these two fields will provide the core of the future developments in rajasthan mr gammell said cairn added that it would be appraising another field early next year mr gammell set

or deny the report iraq is seeking to award contracts for three projects valued at m m turkeys everasia is reported by reuters to have won a contract to develop the khurmala dome field in the north of the country a canadian company named iog is reported to have won the contract to run the himrin field ironhorse oil and gas has denied to reuters that it is the company in question these two projects aim to develop khurmala field to produce barrels per day and raise the output of himrin the winners of the contract are to build new flow lines and build gas separation stations the contract to

iraq has signed with a foreign oil company iraq is still trying to boost its production capacity to match levels last seen in the eighties before the war with iran oil officials hope to double iraqs output by the end of the decade yukos unit fetches bn at auction a littleknown russian company has bought the main production unit of oil giant yukos at auction in moscow baikal finance group outbid favourite gazprom the statecontrolled gas monopoly to buy yuganskneftegas baikal paid bn roubles bn bn for yugansk nowhere near the bn russia says yukos owes in taxes yukos reacted immediately by repeating its view that the auction was illegal in international and russian law and said baikal had bought itself trouble the company considers that the victor of todays auction has bought itself a serious bn headache said yukos spokesman alexander shadrin he said the company would continue to make every lawful move to protect tens of thousands of shareholders in yukos from this forcible and illegitimate removal of their property meanwhile tim osborne head of yukos main shareholders group menatep said that yukos may have to declare itself bankrupt and that legal action would be taken outside russia against the auction winners reports from russia say baikal has paid a deposit of nearly bn from a sberbank savings bank account to the russian federal property fund for yugansk the sale came despite a restraining order issued by a us court dealing with the firms bankruptcy application for chapter protection yukos has always insisted the auction was statesponsored theft but russian authorities argued they were imposing the law trying to recover billions in unpaid taxes there were originally four registered bidders and with its close ties to the kremlin statebacked gas monopoly gazprom had been seen as favourite but just two companies turned up for the auction gazprom and the unknown baikal finance group named after a large freshwater lake in siberia and according to tass news agency gazprom did not make a single bid leaving the way open for baikal which paid above the auction start price of bn roubles mystery firm baikal finance group is officially registered in the central russian region of tver but many analysts believe it may be linked to gazprom kaha kiknavelidze analyst at troika dialog said i think a decision that yugansk should end up with gazprom was taken a long time ago so the main question was how to structure this transaction i would not exclude that the structure of the deal has slightly changed and gazprom now has a partner i would also not exclude that baikal will decline to pay in days that are given by law and gazprom is then recognised as the winner this would give gazprom an extra days to accumulate the needed funds another surprise was that the winner paid a significant premium above the starting price however gazprom has announced it is not linked to baikal in any way and paul collison chief analyst at brunswick ubs said i see no plausible explanation for the theory that baikal was representing competing interests yugansk will most likely end up with gazprom but could still end up with the government there is still potential for surprises yugansk is at the heart of yukos pumping close to a million barrels of oil a day the unit was seized by the government which claims the oil giant owes more than bn in taxes and fines yukos says those tax demands are exorbitant and had sought refuge in us courts the us bankruptcy courts initial order on thursday to temporarily block the sale in response to yukos filing for chapter bankruptcy protection was upheld in a second ruling on saturday the protection if recognised by the russian authorities would have allowed yukos current management to retain control of the business and block the sale of any company assets yukos has said the sale amounts to expropriation punishment for the political ambitions of its founder mikhail khodorkovsky mr khodorkovsky is now in jail on separate fraud charges but president vladimir putin has described the affair as a crackdown on corruption and the bbcs sarah rainsford in moscow says most russians believe the destruction of yukos is now inevitable hours before the auction lawyers for menatep a group through which mr khodorkovsky and his associates control yukos said they would take legal action in other countries menatep lawyers who were excluded from observing the auction said they would retaliate by seeking injunctions in foreign courts to impound russian oil and gas exports sn extends indian beer venture the uks

offered benefits and that it still hoped to make a cash bid last week the lse said not only was the bid undervalued but that it had been advised that there can be no assurance that any transaction could be successfully implemented however it has indicated it is open for further talks meanwhile german magazine der spiegel said part of mr seiferts negotiations with the lse were about where to base the future board of any merged exchange while mr seifert has suggested a merged company would be run out of london the mayor of frankfurt has raised concerns that such a move could cost german

that a deal with euronext which owns the liffe derivatives exchange in london and combines the paris amsterdam and lisbon stock exchanges could potentially offer the lse more cost savings than a deal with deutsche boerse a weekend report in the telegraph had quoted an unnamed executive at euronext as saying the group would make a cash bid to trump deutsche boerses offer because we already own liffe in london the cost savings available to us from a merger are far greater than for deutsche boerse the newspaper quoted the executive as saying euronext chief executive jeanfrancois theodore is

mortgage lenders and economists have predicted that property prices will either fall or stagnate in what is apparent is a picture of a slowing market but one that should remain stable as we return to more normal volumes of lending over as a whole cml director general michael coogan said its a fairly consistent picture showing that mortgage demand has fallen back again which is consistent with a

observers believe that the unit which produces of yukos oil output could ultimately fall into the hands of surgutneftegas or even gazprom the state gas firm which opted out of the auction the russian government forced the sale of yukos most lucrative asset as part of its action to enforce a bn back tax bill it says the company owes yukos us lawyers claim the auction was illegal because the firm

quiet start to with the market picking up in the second half prompting a rise in prices over the coming months fresh hope after argentine crisis three years after argentina was hit by a deadly economic crisis there is fresh hope the countrys economy is set to grow about this year after seeing growth last year a sharp turnaround from when output fell the unemployment rate is improving too it is set to slip below by the end of the year down from in may true problems remain but the overall picture is one of vast improvement even the international monetary fund imf admits this the argentine authorities are proud should be proud of the strong performance of the economy thomas dawson an imf director said earlier this month argentina has made a remarkable recovery from a hideous and lengthy recession which in culminated in the government halting debt repayments to its private creditors the debt default sparked a deep and prolonged economic crisis which at least initially was made worse by the governments decisions pension payments were halted and bank accounts frozen as part of austerity measures introduced by the government to deal with the countrys massive debts in response angry crowds of ordinary argentines took to the streets where dozens of lives were lost in clashes with the police two presidents and at least three finance minister resigned in less than a month argentina was on the brink of collapse the fix was found in the currency markets with the abandonment of the pesos decadelong peg to the us dollar in february the subsequent devaluation saw thousands of peoples life savings disappear scathes of companies went bust three years ago every sector of the economy was hit by the crisis said entrepreneur drayton valentine it really was dire but since then the general mood on the ground has improved dramatically in part because the devaluation helped attract fresh direct investment from abroad and stimulate business within brazil agriculture and tourism are helping said entrepreneur drayton valentine mr valentine who was born in the united states but grew up in argentina was fortunate at the time of the crisis his savings were held in dollar accounts abroad but now he is using his money to help with the startup a trading company he explained that initially his firm is going to export building materials to spain and united states then he would like to diversify to other areas depending on the market locally there is a sense of recovery many companies are exporting now he said noting that a lot of firms which were closed during the crisis are reopening but not all that shines is gold argentina is still burdened by its failure to pay private creditors at the end of president nestor kirchners administration is still trying to hammer out an agreement with the creditors but with the debts nominal value standing at around bn it is not proving easy debt defaults make further lending agreements both difficult and expensive to negotiate argentinas current offer implies that the creditors would get just cents for each dollar they are owed according to the creditors understandably they want more and until they do both they and others are loath to continue lending for president kirchner this proves a hopeless challenge real losses have been suffered and somebody has to pay observed jack boorman adviser to imfs managing director rodrigo rato everyone needs to keep in mind the enormous cost on the part of both creditors and the argentine society and people that will have been endured by the time a settlement is reached he said the cost is enormous and continues to be paid and will not be reversed by any restructuring with the international negotiations being troubled it is of little help to president kirchner that the domestic situation remains strained as well this is partly because there are still bank account holders who are waiting to recover some of their deposits the situation is bad for those who had previously chosen to save in argentina said carlos baez silva president of aara an association that represents bank account and bond holders few people have recovered more than about half their savings mr baez silva estimated pointing out that many of the savers who have lost out are pensioners or others who once trusted the government people who set aside money for the future in the belief that their investment would be safe a lot of them invested in good faith he said the argentine state responded by taking most of their investments the affair has made mr baez silva disillusioned with the countrys legal system on occasion the supreme court has ruled against the interests of the people he represents he says insisting that the system cannot be trusted people have to deposit their money in the banks not necessarily because they trust them but because crime is so high that people cannot have their money in their homes beneath their mattresses mr valentine who was born in the united states but grew up in argentina agreed if i have to save pesos the local currency there is not much problem but i will think twice before i deposit dollars in a bank disney settles disclosure

it followed free market principles vladimir putin said it was quite within the rights of a stateowned company to ensure its interests were met rosneft bought of baikal finance group in a move that amounts to the renationalisation of a major chunk of russias booming oil industry rosneft will now control about of russias total crude oil output yukos share jumped in moscow climbing as much as before being suspended rosneft is already in the process of merging with gazprom the worlds biggest gas company a move that will see gazprom return to majority stateownership baikal was the surprise buyer of oil and gas giant yukoss main production division at a forced auction on sunday everything was done by market methods mr putin said at his yearend press conference in moscow shedding some light on the kremlins motivation mr putin referred to a period of socalled cowboy capitalism that followed the collapse of the soviet union he said privatisations carried out in the early s had involved trickery including law breaking by people seeking to acquire valuable state property now the state using market methods is safeguarding its interests i think this is quite normal the russian president said a rosneft spokesman has said the acquisition is part of its plan to build a balanced national energy corporation the latest announcement comes after more than a year of wrangling that has pushed yukos one of russias biggest companies to the brink of collapse the russian government put yukoss yuganskneftegas subsidiary up for sale last week after hitting the company with a bn bn bill for back taxes and fines analysts say that yukoss legal attempts to block the auction by filing for bankruptcy protection in the us are probably what caused this weeks cloakanddagger dealings gazprom the company originally tipped to buy yuganskneftegas was banned from taking part in the auction by a us court injunction by selling the yukos unit to littleknown baikal and then to rosneft russia is able to circumvent a host of tricky legal landmines analysts said you cannot sue the russian government said eric kraus a strategist at moscows sovlink securities the russian government has sovereign immunity the government is renationalising yuganskneftegas even so analysts reckon that the saga still has a long way to go the rosneft announcement came just hours after yukos accused gazprom of illegally taking part in sundays auction it has said it will be seeking damages of bn the claim was made at the latest hearing in the us bankruptcy court in houston texas where yukos had filed for chapter bankruptcy protection if found in contempt of the us court order blocking the auction gazprom could face having foreign assets seized yukos lawyers had also been expected to try to have baikals assets frozen lawyers claimed the auction was illegal because yukos with an office in houston had filed for bankruptcy and therefore its assets were under the protection of us law which has worldwide jurisdiction further muddying the waters is a merger between rosneft and gazprom which authorities have said will go ahead as planned troubled marsh under sec scrutiny the us stock market regulator is investigating troubled insurance broker marsh mclennans shareholder transactions the firm has said the securities and exchange commission has asked for information about transactions involving holders of or more of the firms shares marsh has said it is cooperating fully with the sec investigation marsh is also the focus of an inquiry the new york attorneygeneral into whether insurers rigged the market since that inquiry was launched in october marsh has replaced its chief executive and held a boardroom shakeout to meet criticism by lessening the number of company executives on the board prosecutors allege that marsh the worlds biggest insurance broker and other us insurance firms may have fixed bids for corporate cover this is the issue at the heart of the

dealings in the trident funds managed by mmc capital the companys private equity firm marshs new chief executive michael cherkasky is trying to negotiate a settlement with mr spitzer mr spitzer has built up a reputation as a fierce critic and campaigner against corporate americas misdeeds the uncertainty unleashed by the scandal has prompted three credit rating agencies standard poors moodys and fitch to downgrade marsh in recent weeks according to the financial times insurance analysts are now questioning whether marsh will be able to maintain its strong record of earning growth as they draw up forecasts for the first quarter of next year doubts also exist over how much the company may have to pay regulators and lawyers to put the scandal behind us firm pulls out of iraq a us company has

m m sex discrimination case against the us investment bank an employment tribunal dismissed stephanie villalbas allegations of sexual discrimination and unequal pay but the yearold won her claim of

promoting interethnic accord and pushing through harsh reforms deutsche attacks yukos case german investment bank deutsche bank has challenged the right of yukos to claim bankruptcy protection in the us in a court filing on tuesday it said the russian oil giant has few texas ties beyond bank accounts and a texasbased finance chief deutsche bank claimed yukos had artificially manufactured a legal case to stop the sale of its main asset it had wanted to help fund gazproms plans for a bn bn bid for yukos unit yuganskneftegas deutsche bank would have earned large fees from the deal which could not be carried out because us chapter bankruptcy rules made the kremlins auction of yuganskneftegas on december illegal under us law but the us bankruptcy court judge in texas granted yukos an injunction that barred gazprom and its lenders from taking part yuganskneftegas will ultimately end up with gazprom the winning bidder at the auction was a previously unknown firm baikal finance group which was snapped up days later by rosneft a russian oil firm that is in the process of merging with gazprom the effect of these transactions is to renationalise yuganskneftegas deutsche bank contends yukos filed for bankruptcy earlier this month in texas in a desperate and unsuccessful bid to stave off the december auction of its top unit by the russian government which was in a tax dispute with yukos this blatant attempt to artificially manufacture a basis for jurisdiction constitutes cause to dismiss this case deutsche bank said in its court filing mike lake a spokesman for yukos lawyers said on tuesday that the company stands by its legal action yukos is confident of its right to us bankruptcy protection and we are prepared to be back in court defending that position again he said yukos has said it intends to seek bn in damages from the buyer of yuganskneftegas once the sale finally goes through in its filing deutsche bank said houston was a jurisdiction in which yukos owns no real or personal property and conducts no business operations it also said the us bankruptcy court should not become involved in a tax dispute between the federation and one of its corporate citizens it suggested the european court or an international arbitration tribunal were more appropriate jurisdictions for the legal fight between russia and yukos the next hearing in the bankruptcy is expected on january analysts believe the tax dispute between the russian government and yukos is partly driven by russian president vladimir putins hostility hostility to the political ambitions of exyukos boss mikhail khordokovsky mr khodorkovsky is in jail and on trial for fraud and tax evasion us consumer confidence up consumers confidence in the state of the us economy is at its highest for five

every legal means the company wants damages of bn claiming yuganskneftegas was sold at less than market value judge letitia clark will hear different motions including one from deutsche bank to throw out the chapter bankruptcy filing the german lender is one of six banks that were barred from providing financing to gazprom the russian stateowned company that was expected to win the auction for yuganskneftegas deutsche bank which is also an advisor to gazprom has called on the us court to overturn its decision to provide yukos with bankruptcy protection lifting the injunction would remove the uncertainty that surrounds the court case and clarify deutsche banks business position analysts said analysts are not optimistic about yukos chances in court russian president vladimir putin and the countrys legal authorities have repeatedly said that the us has no jurisdiction over yukos and its legal wranglings on top of that the firm only has limited assets in the us yukos has won small victories however and is bullish about its chances in court do we have an ability to influence what happens we think we do said mike lake a yukos spokesman the litigation risks are real said credit

major way companies can reduce their environmental impact the survey is published by corporate social responsibility firm context and branding firm salterbaxter blake leeharwood campaigns director at greenpeace in the uk said its fairly meaningless to talk about your companys direction in terms of sustainability without having detailed knowledge of your supply chain its also important to get some kind of independent assessment of your reporting less than a quarter of companies get their corporate social responsibility csr reports independently verified to provide assurances they are accurate and complete says the survey to date there are no set standards for nonfinancial reporting although the global reporting initiative an independent prosustainability institution is planning to establish some the reports surveyed by directions are published voluntarily they are usually called corporate social responsibility csr reports sustainability reports or social and environmental reports peter knight director of context says uk top companies reported for the first time this year and in general the quality of reports has improved the corporate lexicon of homilies generalities and soft assurances fluff is on its way out there are less pictures of smiling children and butterflies the uk government will soon require all quoted companies to report their social and environmental risks in a chapter in their annual reports called the operating and financial review the regulation is not expected until and the first reports under this scheme will not be published

industry analysts douglaswestwood india is a dramatically growing economy that must have access to oil by buying into yugansk ongc would be able to reduce its dependence on gulf states for oil imports

production may only be at half of todays levels ongc which is majorityowned by the indian state already has bought petroleum assets in countries including vietnam sudan and russia the company is a

settlement will be put to the courts for approval next week enron went bankrupt in after it emerged it had hidden hundreds of millions of dollars in debt before its collapse the firm was the seventh biggest public us company by revenue its demise sent shockwaves through financial markets and dented investor confidence in corporate america the settlement is very significant in holding these outside directors at least partially personally responsible william lerach the lawyer leading the class action suit against enron said hopefully this will help send a message to corporate boardrooms

job growth continues in us the us created fewer jobs than expected in december but analysts said that the dip in hiring was not enough to derail the worlds biggest economy according to labor department figures new jobs were added last month that took s total to million the best showing in five years job creation was one of last years main concerns for the us economy while worries still remain the conditions are set for steady growth in analysts said the unemployment rate stayed at in december and about jobs will need to be created each month if that figure is to drop it was a respectable report said michael moran analyst at daiwa securities payroll growth in december was a little lighter than the consensus forecast but we had upward revisions to the prior two months and an increase in manufacturing employment manufacturing is a cyclical area of the economy and if its showing job growth its a good indication that the economy is on a solid growth track that means that the federal reserve is likely to continue its policy of raising interest rates the fed lifted borrowing costs five times last year to citing evidence the us economic recovery was becoming more robust job creation was one of last years main concerns for the us economy and proved to be a main topic of debate in the us presidential election while demand for workers is far from booming the conditions are set for steady growth overall compared to the previous year it looks great it just keeps going stronger and stronger and i expect that to be the case in said kurt karl economist at swiss re in new york meanwhile economists cautioned against reading too much into data from the federal reserve showing an unexpected bn drop in consumer debt in november a fall in consumer spending which makes up about twothirds of all us economic activity could help limit the extent of any future interest rate rises but economists said there could be a number of reasons for a fall in the borrowing which include credit cards and personal loans while noting that such figures can vary on a monthtomonth basis barclays shares up on merger talk shares in uk banking group barclays have risen on monday

deutsche boerse and rival euronext held talks with the london market last week over a possible offer a bn offer from deutsche boerse has already been rejected while euronext has said it will make an all cash bid speculation suggests that parisbased euronext has the facilities in place to make a bid of bn while its german rival may up its bid to the bn mark neither has yet tabled a formal bid but the lse is expected to hold further talks with the two parties later this week however the sunday telegraph report added that there are signs that deutsche boerse chief executive werner seifert is becoming increasingly impatient with the lses managed bid process despite insisting he wants to agree a recommended deal with the lses board the newspaper suggested he may pull out of the process and put an offer directly to shareholders instead the newspaper also claimed mr seifert was becoming increasingly frustrated with the pace of negotiations since deutsche boerses bn offer was rejected in middecember in particular the lses decision to suspend talks over the christmas period meanwhile the german exchanges offer has come under fire recently unions for deutsche boerse staff in frankfurt have reportedly expressed fears that up to jobs would be moved to london if the takeover is successful others claim it will weaken the citys status as europes financial centre while german politicians are also said to be angry over the market operators promise to move its headquarters to london if a bid is successful a further stumbling block is deutsche boerses control over its clearstream unit

on january mr fischer will face a delicate balancing act both in political and economic terms between mr sharon and finance minister binyamin netanyahu who also backed his nomination but his appointment has also raised hopes that it could bring in fresh investment and perhaps even an improvement in the countrys credit rating mr fischer first went to israel for six months in and almost

the restatement chinese exports rise in exports from china leapt during over the previous year as the country continued to show breakneck growth the spurt put chinas trade surplus a sore point with some of its trading partners at a sixyear high it may also increase pressure on china to relax the peg joining its currency the yuan with the weakening dollar the figures released by the ministry of commerce come as chinas tax chief confirmed that growth had topped in for the second year in a row state administration of taxation head xie xuren said a tightening of controls on tax evasion had combined with the rapid expansion to produce a rise in tax revenues to trillion yuan bn bn according to the ministry of commerce chinas exports totalled bn in december taking the annual total up to bn with imports rising a similar amount the deficit rose to bn the increased tax take comes despite healthy tax rebates for many exporters totalling bn yuan in according to mr xie chinas exporting success has made the trade deficit of the united states soar even further and made trade with china a sensitive political issue in washington the peg keeping the yuan around to the dollar is often

the index rising pakistani investors are expecting the kse to repeat if not improve on its performance jubilant investors danced on the streets as the market closed for the day on tuesday confident that the boom will continue at least until the public holiday on january others however who had stayed out fearing an imminent collapse because of prices overheating continued to warn that the bubble may burst any time thats rubbish kse chairman yaseen lakhani told the bbc news website whenever the market reflects pakistans true economic reality it is described as a bubble mr lakhani feels that the market has risen on the basis of solid economic growth and its current level rests on sound foundations market analysts are inclined to agree with mr lakhani arguing that there are a number of major factors behind the kses performance analysts argue that a steady improvement in pakistans credit ratings by international credit rating agencies has finally begun to register in the market standard poors upgraded pakistan a few weeks ago there are indications of yet another upgrade by the end of february then say analysts there is corporate profitability in the current fiscal year which has gone up by from last year coupled with the gdp growth expected by june this year i am least surprised at the markets performance says mr lakhani one leading karachi broker said the real reasons may be political if you file a trillion case against saudi money after arab money will not go to the us any more a lot of arab money he says has already gone to malaysia and indonesia pakistanis are now hoping that energy and telecoms two of the strongest sectors in pakistan draw some of the arab money to the kse locally too say analysts recent political developments have worked to the markets advantage an antimusharraf campaign threatened by the mma a countrywide alliance of religious parties has fizzled out the release of asif zardari former prime minister benazir bhuttos husband has eased political tensions between the militarybacked government and the opposition pakistan peoples party most importantly say analysts the failure of talks between india and pakistan on the baglihar dam in indianadministered kashmir has not automatically led to heightened tensions this they say indicates that neither country is interested in raising the temperature at this stage irrespective of the state of their disagreements the market is abuzz with speculation that substantial investment may now start to flow in from the us a country seen locally as deeply interested in defusing tensions between the south asian neighbours you can call it a peace dividend smiles one broker let us see how long one can reap its benefits us trade gap ballooned in october the us trade deficit widened by more than expected in october hitting record levels after higher oil prices raised import costs figures have shown the trade shortfall was bn bn up from september the commerce department said that pushed the month deficit to bn imports rose by while exports increased by only a weaker dollar also increased the cost of imports though this should help drive export demand in coming months things are getting worse but thats to be expected said david wyss of standard poors in new york the first thing is that when the dollar goes down it increases the price of imports we are seeing improved export orders things seem to be going in the right direction despite this optimism significant concerns remain as to how the us will fund its trade and budget deficits should they continue to widen another problem highlighted by analysts was the growing trade gap with china which has been accused of keeping its currency artificially weak in order to boost exports the us imported almost bn worth of goods from china during october exporting a little under bn it seems the key worry that has existed in the currency market still remains said anthony crescenzi a bond strategist at miller tabak in new york the trade deficit and the shortfall with china are big issues going forward the commerce department figures caused the dollar to weaken further despite widespread expectations that the federal reserve will raise interest rates for a fifth time this year borrowing costs are tipped to rise by a quarter of a percentage point to at a fed meeting later on tuesday us prepares for hybrid

million people across asia could be thrown into poverty because of the indian ocean tsunami the asian development bank adb has said in its first overview of the disaster the adb said the impact on economic growth would be slight because major cities and factories escaped damage but the blow to many lowincome people could be enormous the paris club of rich creditor nations on wednesday offered to freeze debts owed by tsunamihit countries the move was aimed at helping south asian governments find budgets to rebuild devastated coastal areas though so far only sri lanka indonesia and the seychelles have indicated that they will take it up other countries believe their economies are strong enough to cope or wish to avoid being viewed as credit risks poverty is potentially the most important impact of this natural disaster said adb chief economist ifzal ali donor nations have promised to give m m in disaster relief over the next six months according to the united nations mr ali added his voice to those warning that aid pledges must be promptly delivered saying the number of people at risk of poverty hinged on concerns over sanitation and health conditions and other basic needs being properly and quickly addressed there are billion people in asia living on less than a day the adb fears that million indonesians could join them while in india just over half a million people are at risk of falling into poverty a quarter of a million sri lankans and people in the maldives are also facing poverty in the maldives where of the population already lives on less than a day this could rise to half sri lanka and the maldives are the two countries the adb fears are most at risk of suffering lasting economic damage from the tsunami sri lankas government has estimated reconstruction costs at nearly bn a government task force held meetings to discuss an emergency rebuilding plan with the adb world bank and japanese aid agencies on wednesday and promised to publish the plan within days indonesia malaysia thailand and india have enjoyed strong economic growth in recent years which should cushion them against reconstruction costs although indonesias northern province of aceh suffered the worst death toll the regions oil and natural gas production facilities have survived intact the report said however it remains too soon to asses the damage to poor peoples livelihoods in aceh because it would depend on how much farm land had been flooded by seawater this is a profoundly tragic event for the region and for the millions who are suffering but the economies of the affected countries except sri lanka and the maldives should emerge with minimal damage the adb report said some businesses may even gain from the reconstruction efforts thereby creating jobs at a meeting in thailand abd president thadao chino said he was confident of the countrys own capabilities to restore normalcy to the affected areas and meet the rehabilitation requirements thailand has said it does not wish to opt for a debt repayment freeze while india has also rejected international aid saying it can cope on its own resources debt repayment holidays carry the risk of credit ratings downgrades making it more expensive to borrow money in future indonesia however is pressing for greater help with its debts than the current freeze would bring it is one of

bought of southcorp the global winemaker behind the penfolds lindemans and rosemount brands for australian dollars per share a bid at that price would value the company at abn bn bn fosters said it

australian firm brl hardy for just over bn in since then it has paid bn for us wine maker robert mondavi bought last month fosters main wine business is beringer blass wine estate its best known brand is fosters lager though it makes a clutch of beer brands and spirits analysts were divided on thursday about whether fosters was more likely to go for a takeover or merely wanted to take a big enough chunk of southcorp to prevent it falling to a rival currently i think the strategic position is more sensible rather than an outright takeover said one analyst quoted by the agence france presse news agency however matt williams a fund manager at perpetual trustees said taking the stake is definitely a precursor to a takeover us trade deficit widens sharply the gap between us exports and imports has widened to more than bn bn an alltime record figures from the commerce department for november showed exports down to bn while imports grew to bn on rising consumer demand part of the expanding deficit came from high prices for oil imports but the numbers suggested the sliding dollar which makes exports less expensive has had little impact and could indicate slowing economic growth the trade deficit far bigger than the bn widely expected on wall street prompted a rapid response from the currency markets by gmt the dollar was trading against the euro at almost a cent and a half weaker than before the announcement against the pound the dollar was down about at the dollars fall has been sudden violent and appropriate given this number said brian taylor of wells fargo in minneapolis recent exchange rate movements certainly havent had any impact yet treasury secretary john snow put a brave face on the news saying it was a sign of strong economic expansion the economy is growing at such a fast rate that it is generating lots of disposable income some of which is used to buy goods from our trading partners although the white house officially still backs the uss traditional strong dollar policy it has tacitly indicated that it would be happy if the slide continued the dollar has fallen by against the euro as well as by against the yen in the past three years the main catalyst most economists accept is the large budget deficit on the one hand and the current account deficit the difference between the flow of money in and out of the us on the other the trade deficit is a large part of the latter in november the fall in exports was largely due to a decline in sales of industrial supplies and materials such as chemicals as well as of cars consumer goods and food one small bright spot for us policymakers was a slight decline in the deficit with china often blamed for job losses and other economic woes although chinas overall trade surplus is expanding according to chinese government figures the commerce department revealed the uss deficit with china was bn in november down from bn the month before but the deficit with japan was at its worst in more than four years trade gap narrows as exports rise the uks trade gap narrowed in november helped by a rise in exports outside the european union according to the office for national statistics the difference between what the uk exported and imported was bn bn down from octobers bn overall uk exports including both goods and services rose by more than to bn although total imports rose again to a new record of bn the deficit for goods alone was bn down from octobers bn during november the uk exported bn worth of goods but imported bn the cumulative deficit for the first eleven months of now stands at bn bn higher than the same period in november saw an improvement in export levels to both the european union and the rest of the world the office for national statistics ons said eu exports rose fuelled by an increase in sales of chemicals noneu exports shot up with growth seen across a range of manufacturing sectors including cars consumer durables and chemicals the export boost offset a rise in imports noneu imports rose but the growth in goods entering the uk from the eu slowed to the uks deficit with the eu fell to bn from bn while its noneu shortfall dropped to bn from bn in october the countrys surplus on tradeinservices remained steady at bn for the fifth month in a row paul dales uk economist for capital economics said the figures represented an improvement on recent months however he stressed that the longterm prognosis for exports was still uncertain the figures are a lot better than expected but the trend still remains poor he said there have been some very encouraging signs that the uk export recovery is starting to take hold but there is a danger that this could be held back by the ongoing weakness of domestic demand on the continent lesotho textile workers lose jobs six foreignowned textile factories have closed in lesotho leaving garment workers jobless union officers told the ap news agency factory workers union secretary general billy macaefa blamed the closures on the end of worldwide textile quotas the quotas for developing nations ended on january gave them a set share of the rich countries markets they also limited the amount countries like china could export to the big markets of the united states and eu we understand that some owners were complaining that the south african rand was strong against the us dollar and they were losing when exporting textiles and clothing to the united states mr macaefa said at a news briefing in the capital maseru lesothos currency the maloti is fixed to the rand but we suspect that they left the country unceremoniously because of the end of quotas introduced by the world trade organization he said the six factories were leisure garments modern garments precious six garments tw garments lesotho hats and vogue landmark the owners two from taiwan two from china one from mauritius and one from malaysia left over the december holiday period without informing or paying their employees he said union leaders and trade campaigners have been warning that developing nations such as lesotho sri lanka and bangaldesh could lose thousands of jobs once the quotas were lifted in the mountainous country surrounded by south africa it is feared as many as textile workers could lose their jobs and mr mafeca said he expected more companies to leave the assistance of a us law had given lesothos textiles dutyfree access to north american markets the african growth and opportunity act agoa gave subsaharan countries preferential access to the us market for apparel and textile products as well

said we are however operating in a global market and there is no room for complacency simply because we are currently profitable and successful unions reacted angrily to the reported disclosure arguing that qantas was profitable and did not need to take such action we could understand if qantas was a struggling airline about to go under michael mijatov international division secretary of the flight attendants association told agence france presse qantas announced a record profit last year and is on course this year for an even greater profit so it is totally unnecessary in an effort to

german chancellor gerhard schroeder has called for radical reform of the eus stability pact to grant countries more flexibility over their budget deficits mr schroeder said existing fiscal rules should be loosened to allow countries to run deficits above the current limit if they met certain criteria writing in the financial times mr schroeder also said heads of government should have a greater say in reforms changes to the pact are due to be agreed at an economic summit in march the current eu rules limit the size of a eurozone countrys deficit to of gdp countries which exceed the threshold are liable to heavy fines by the european commission although several countries including germany have breached the rules consistently since without facing punishment the european commission acknowledged last month that it would not impose sanctions on countries who break the rules mr schroeder a staunch supporter of the pact when it was set up in the s said exemptions were now needed to take into account the cost of domestic reform programmes and changing economic conditions the stability pact will work better if intervention by european institutions in the budgetary sovereignty of national parliaments is only permitted under very limited conditions he wrote only if their competences are respected will the member states be willing to align their policies more consistently with the economic goals of the eu deficits should be allowed to rise above mr schroeder argued if countries meet several mandatory criteria these include governments which are adopting costly structural reforms countries which are suffering economic stagnation and nations which are shouldering special economic burdens the proposed changes would make it harder for the european commission to launch infringement action against any state which breaches the pacts rules mr schroeders intervention comes ahead of a meeting of the eurozone finance ministers on monday to discuss the pact the issue will also be discussed at tuesdays ecofin meeting of the finance ministers of all eu members mr schroeder also called for heads of government to play a larger role in shaping reforms to the pact a number

the worst christmas since retail sales dropped by on the month in december after a rise in november the office for national statistics ons said the ons revised the annual rate of growth down from the estimated in november to a number of retailers have already reported poor figures for december clothing retailers and nonspecialist stores were the worst hit with only internet retailers showing any significant growth according to the ons the last time retailers endured a tougher christmas was years previously when sales plunged the ons echoed an earlier caution from bank of england governor mervyn king not to read too much into the poor december figures some analysts put a positive gloss on the figures pointing out that the nonseasonallyadjusted figures showed a performance comparable with the novemberdecember jump last year was roughly comparable with recent averages although some way below the serious booms seen in the s and figures for retail volume outperformed measures of actual spending an indication that consumers are looking for bargains and retailers are cutting their prices however reports from some high street retailers highlight the weakness of the sector morrisons woolworths house of fraser marks spencer and big food all said that the festive period was disappointing and a british retail consortium survey found that christmas was the worst for years yet other retailers including hmv monsoon jessops body shop and tesco reported that festive sales were well up on last year investec chief economist philip shaw said he did not expect the poor retail figures to have any immediate effect on interest rates the retail sales figures are very weak but as bank of england governor mervyn king indicated last night you dont really get an accurate impression of christmas trading until about easter said mr shaw our view is the bank of england will keep its powder dry and wait to see the big picture businesses fail to plan for hiv companies fail

agency too few companies are responding proactively to the social and business threats said dr kate taylor head of the wefs global health initiative nearly business leaders in countries were surveyed for business and hivaids commitment and action dr taylor described the level of action taken by businesses as revealed by the report as too little too late the issue will be highlighted to business

dropped by in the last months most have no policies in place to address the disease nor could over of the business leaders surveyed say or estimate the prevalence of hiv among their staff the un

counselling and testing for hiv infection coupled with antiretroviral therapy for employees progressing to aids over of the employees who have accessed and remained on treatment are well and have returned to normal work effective action on hivaids is synonymous with good business management and leads to more profitable and sustainable operations said brian brink senior vicepresident health at angloamerican companies should encourage all workers to know their hiv status making it as routine as monitoring blood pressure or cholesterol he said providing access to treatment is a critical part of this across subsaharan africa even in countries with an hiv prevalence of only around of companies have formal hivaids policies in place according to the report the gap is even wider in china ethiopia india nigeria and russia the socalled next wave countries which are predicted to experience the highest numbers of new hivaids cases worldwide by the report adds an important building block to our understanding of how the business community is experiencing the hivaids epidemic and to whether and how it is reacting said david bloom professor of economics and demography at the harvard

corporate governance rules to ease the burden on foreign firms in a speech at the london school of economics william donaldson promised several initiatives european firms have protested that us laws introduced after the enron scandal make wall street listings too costly the us regulator said foreign firms may get extra time to comply with a key clause in the sarbanesoxley act the act comes into force in mid it obliges all firms with us stock market listings to make declarations which critics say will add substantially to the cost of preparing their annual accounts firms that break the new law could face huge fines while senior executives risk jail terms of up to years mr donaldson said that although the act does not provide exemptions for foreign firms the securities and exchange commission sec would continue to be sensitive to the need to accomodate foreign structures and requirements there are few if any who disagree with the intentions of the act which obliges chief executives to sign a statement taking responsibility for the accuracy of the accounts but european firms with secondary listings in new york have objected arguing that the compliance costs outweigh the benefits of a dual listing the act also applies to firms with more than us shareholders a situation many firms without us listings could find themselves in the shareholder threshold has drawn anger as it effectively blocks the most obvious remedy a delisting mr donaldson said the sec would consider whether there should be a new approach to the deregistration process for foreign firms unwilling to meet us requirements we should seek a solution that will preserve investor protections without turning the us market into one with no exit he said he revealed that his staff were already weighing up the merits of delaying the implementation of the acts least popular measure section for foreign firms seen as particularly costly to implement section obliges chief executives to take responsibility for the firms internal controls by signing a compliance statement in the annual accounts the sec has already delayed implementation of this clause for smaller firms including us ones

world economy has picked up from difficult times just a few years ago people seem to not have fully absorbed this development though they are personally experiencing its effects said pipa director steven kull people around the world are saying im ok but the world isnt there may be a perception that war terrorism and religious and political divisions are making the world a worse place even though that has not so far been reflected in global economic performance says the bbcs elizabeth blunt the countries where people were most optimistic both for the world and for their own families were two fastgrowing developing economies china and india followed by indonesia china has seen two decades of blistering economic growth which has led to wealth creation on a huge scale says the bbcs louisa lim in beijing but the results also may reflect the untrammelled confidence of people who are subject to endless government propaganda about their countrys rosy economic future our correspondent says south korea was the most pessimistic while respondents in italy and mexico were also quite gloomy the bbcs david willey in rome says one reason for that result is the changeover from the lira to the euro in which is widely viewed as the biggest reason why their wages and salaries are worth less than they used to be the philippines was among the most upbeat countries on prospects for respondents families but one of the most pessimistic about the world economy pipa conducted the poll from november to january across countries in facetoface or telephone interviews the

europe asks asia for euro help european leaders say asian states must let their currencies rise against the us dollar to ease pressure on the euro the european single currency has shot up to successive alltime highs against the dollar over the past few months tacit approval from the white house for the weaker greenback which could help counteract huge deficits has helped trigger the move but now europe says the euro has had enough and asia must now share some of the burden china is seen as the main culprit with exports soaring up in partly on the back of a currency pegged to the dollar asia should engage in greater currency flexibility said french finance minister herve gaymard after a meeting with his german counterpart hans eichel markets responded by pushing the euro lower

spreading negative publicity via his newsletter the egyptianborn analyst would extort money from his targets in return for stopping the attacks prosecutors said under the guise of protecting investors

office for national statistics ons the figure is in line with treasury and bank of england forecasts the ons says gross domestic product gdp rose by a strong in the three months to december compared with in the previous quarter the rise came despite a further decline in production output and the worst christmas for retailers in decades the annual figure marked out the best year since and was also well ahead of the recorded in growth in the final three months of marked the th consecutive quarter of expansion on the basis of the latest information the uk has entered on course to continue its record period of growth said paul boateng chief secretary to the treasury in a statement the ons said the services sector which accounts for nearly threequarters of the uk economy grew in the quarter the strong services figure was welcomed by analysts given lacklustre retail sales in december and across the christmas holiday period the fact that other services components are doing so well suggests to me that we are back to trend growth and i am not particularly concerned about any further slowdown said ross walker uk economist at rbs financial markets however output in the production sector contracted the second quarterly fall in row and a state of affairs that some economists classify as a recession however the ons would not comment on the definition of a recession and whether the manufacturing recovery was over but steve radley chief economist at the manufacturers organisation eef said these figures remain at odds with what is actually happening on the ground whilst companies may be experiencing tougher conditions this year recession is not a word that manufacturers would currently recognise the ons said a sharp fall in mining and quarrying which was driven by oil and gas extraction was primarily responsible for the overall contraction in manufacturing production figures simon rubinsohn chief economist at gerrard said this outturn of was well ahead of the market expectations and cast doubt on the scare stories doing the rounds surrounding the current state of the uk economy and he said the gdp figures may help to push interest rate expectations a little higher along the curve the suggestion from the money markets is that the next move is now more likely to be in an upward rather than a downward direction this is consistent with our own thinking said
