photographs of him apparently exposing himself via a webcam from his dressing room he also allegedly insulted four costars he apologised for his deplorable actions and a moments stupidity dvd review harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban this third harry potter film brought a change of director and a dramatic visual shakeup that really shines on dvd gone are the warm bright colours found in the two earlier films alfonso cuaron brings in a bleak and cold feel that is simply gorgeous and looks even better here than in the cinema it is all part of the progression of harrys story into darker areas but youll spend time just marvelling at the beautiful hogwarts landscape this is the first potter film where you get so lost in the screen adaptation that you forget the book it is the third year at hogwarts and studies are interrupted as they always are by a calamity that only harry ron and hermione can put right it sounds corny but harry is no longer the winsome hero he is a moody teenager and daniel radcliffe pulls it off very well emma watson is ever better as hermione and the young stars are joined by the usual myriad famous actors including gary oldman and emma thompson the film itself is the reason to buy this dvd but it is laden with behindthescenes extras including funny if shallow interviews with all the main cast but what seems like a long list of features can be swiftly whittled down to the few that you are going to watch younger viewers will go for the games which include a magic you may have missed memory test and crookshanks chasing off after scabbers adult viewers will ignore those and go straight to the deleted scenes you will understand why they were deleted but it is fun to see more footage and not have to hunt through endless menus to find it as we did on the first harry potter dvd the most interesting pieces are an interview with jk rowling in creating the vision and conjuring a scene a short featurette about the making of the films big moments vera drake scoops film award oscar hopefuls mike leigh and imelda staunton were both winners at the evening standard british film awards vera drake leighs s drama about a backstreet

general production diary and a postproduction feature remember the national lotterys draw machines arthur and guinevere they were more accurate than this glossy hollywood version of the tale but as long as youre not expecting a documentary live with it king arthur is a fun exciting totally shallow experience and looks excellent clive owen is the brooding king keira knightly rises above her costume and ray winstone gives it all some grit its at its best in its battle scenes which are well done and are also the best part of the making of extra less flashy than a david attenborough show

gangsters on the silver screen every time she went to see brando from then on she added he was wearing a different gangsterstyle moustache brando was asked to screen test for the role in the godfather as studio executives were said to be reluctant for the actor to play the part following problems on the set of brandos previous film mutiny on the bounty in fact brandos academy award triumph revived his career the actor was nominated for an oscar the following year for his role in bernardo bertoluccis last tango in paris before his death brando granted gaming company electronic arts the rights to

die in a fire they are taken in by their wicked uncle count olaf played by carrey who schemes to get his hands on their fortune director nairs vanity project indian film director mira nair has said she was thrilled to be given the chance to make william makepeace thackerays novel vanity fair as the book has been a favourite through her life the book is one of the classics of english literature the story of scheming th century social climber becky sharp played in the film by reese witherspoon nair said that she jumped at the chance to work on the film which she has controversially made in a bollywood style including two songanddance routines in the films second half it was serendipity really i was offered vanity fair by the studio focus features who had distributed monsoon wedding nair told bbc world services masterpiece programme they offered me their nextbest thing not realising that vanity fair had actually been one of my favourite novels since i was years old in an irish catholic boarding school in india since her debut feature salaam bombay nominated for the best foreign language oscar and winner of best first feature at cannes nair has become one of indias most famous and respected directors she is not restricted to bollywood however she followed salaam bombay with mississippi masala starring denzel washington and the perez family her first hollywood film her career peaked with monsoon wedding in which won the golden lion award at venice nairs indianstyle adaptation of vanity fair however has been attacked by critics in the us where it only reached number eight at the box office in its opening week who described the bollywood elements as jarring the film has a new ending with becky sharp running off for a new life in india but nair said that her film had picked up on the way thackeray who was born in india but moved to england as a young man had seen the world first when i was it was becky sharp who is a completely memorable character because i recognised myself in her i recognised all the ladies who did not want to be ladies who wanted to buck the system that they were in she said but it was the sort of novel i somehow kept at the side of my bed for many years and i would dip into every now and then and suddenly get completely mesmerised again as i got older and read it i think it was thackerays clarity his clearsightedness about his own society the fact that he was born in india but came to england as a young man that gave him the eyes of an outsider and yet he was an insider that perspective was something i really loved nair also defended her decision to cast an american actress reese witherspoon as becky sharp despite the fact that all the rest of the cast are british or irish i cast intuitively in my films i cast as many nonactors as i cast actors she said for me it is intuition i have to fall in love with an actor it is a visceral response thackeray describes becky sharp as a minx also shes described as someone whos tiny redheaded and thin reese had that completely minxlike irresistibility about her having won the role because she seemed physically perfectly suited to the part however witherspoon then became pregnant but nair said that though this had created the need for some filming tricks it had in fact also helped the film it was a selffulfilling prophesy when i first met her husband actor ryan philippe i said knock her up wont you i need some flesh on the girl she joked im not a fan of the underfed los angeles actor at all this was for me about becky sharp being eventually a fullblown woman through the course of the film i love the luminosity that pregnancy brings i love the fleshiness i love the ample bosom it gave me much more to play with nair explained how camera tricks had been used to disguise witherspoons bump in various scenes including hiring a number of young boys in costumes to stand in front of her she runs she gets off coal carts she jumps off horses she does everything nair said but theres also a certain carriage with horses that is going to wipe the screen at a certain moment because of the bump spirit awards hail sideways the comedy sideways has dominated this

staunton kate winslet and director mike leigh the aviator leads the shortlist but critics believe the night may belong to clint eastwoods million dollar baby a recent poll of us pundits found eastwoods boxing drama had become the new favourite to win best film over the howard hughes biopic if the yearold does win he will become the oldest person ever to be named best director at the

film can either be a superhero special effects extravaganza or it can be good but spiderman breaks that rule in two its not fantastically deep but you get quickly drawn into the tale of spidey versus doc ock and more so into the fate of poor peter parker gigantic action set pieces seamlessly work with more brooding personal torment and it all looks stunning a few effects look false but tobey maguire kirsten dunst and alfred molina make this compelling the other universal rule is that dvds of superhero films will have making of features only about the effects this disc covers those special effects enough but as just one part of a detailed look at the film then there are commentaries trailers and a blooper reel sometimes quality comes in bulk this set contains no less than john wayne films ranging from the westerns and war movies to the quiet man now is that a christmas present or what give this to someone on december and you wont see them again until early in the new year its not truly a complete collection and leans more toward waynes earlier films theres no true grit for instance though there is hellraisers the films look well transferred to dvd though none has extras it was very daft but it knew it was and somehow this famous series became a cult favourite thats been long awaited on dvd this set has the first season of buck gil gerard and wilmas erin gray tongueincheek adventures and its all as camp and gaudy as you remember but its also a disappointment the us dvd has this and the more pofaced second season and you can import it for just about the same price the bigger omission though is that there are no extras thats particularly disappointing because originally there were meant to be commentaries and stars gerard and gray had agreed to do them us tv cuts nudity from bbc film a us tv network is editing bbc films dirty war to avoid showing the front of a nude woman being scrubbed down after a fictional chemical attack it is not worth showing nonessential nude scenes when indecency complaints are aggressively pursued by us tv watchdogs said pbs jacoba atlas dirty war screened uncut on bbc one last september depicts a dirty bomb attack on the city of london it is also being screened uncut on us cable channel hbo on january pbs said it will use extra footage for its broadcast showing the woman from a more discreet angle instead the us federal communications commission fined cbs last autumn for singer janet jacksons wardrobe malfunction during which her breast was exposed during a dance routine with justin timberlake many us networks and broadcasters are now more nervous about airing nudity violence or bad language ms atlas said pbs could put itself financially at risk if it showed the uncut version of dirty war and it could also deter many of its individual stations from airing an important film you want to pick your battles she said she added that pbs which is a private nonprofit media enterprise owned and operated by the nations public television stations is bolder about screening nonfiction or historical programming pbs is seen in virtually all us homes with tv and describes itself as a trusted

it rained on oscars night was in the midtolate s said oscars communications director john pavlik we have had rain up until the day before the show many times but for some reason the oscar gods always shine on sunday and we hope they will do so again this year he added aviator creator in oscars snub the man who said he got oscarnominated movie the aviator off the ground and signed up leonardo

remember going to see dates in milan and turin and they were enormous concerts bob was one of the most mesmeric people ive ever had the privilege to work with he must have had an iron will to succeed bob was a very driven individual you realised from the start there was a manifest destiny within him that he believed in he didnt suffer fools gladly at the risk of stating the obvious he was an extraordinary song writer and his stage act was perhaps the greatest ive ever seen i saw him many times i recall in he came to the uk for top of the pops and a daily mirror journalist did a halfhour interview it was interrupted to do a rehearsal he came back into the dressing room to resume the interview but saw a world cup match on tv he sat down in front of the tv and after minutes it was obvious he wasnt going to move that was the end of it the mirror had a very truncated interview the last time i saw him was in london in i arranged for him to play four days of football indoors in fulham bob was a good player we are talking about jamaicanstyle football he was an attacking midfield player his team assembled wherever his gigs were we played in brazil against some world cupwinning players it was always a struggle for him to connect with black america reggae did not correspond with disco in the s but bob in the s became one of the great icons in america and the third world in ten years after his death he sold more records than at any time during his life we saw black america taking bob into their hearts for the first time bob in worldwide terms is the greatest music star there has ever been if you went to africa he would be recognised everywhere in places john lennon or elvis wouldnt be no disrespect to the other artists but a case can be made for him as the greatest the best and the most influential artist in popular music well was to be the year he toured africa with stevie wonder he had only performed in zimbabwe and guinea before of course the tour never happened but the whole of africa would have embraced him we cant speculate but he was at the height of his powers and just years old i had no sense his career was going to go downhill bob was endlessly optimistic about the way africa would turn out he realised that nothing was perfect but he had total belief in the power of mankind im sure if he were alive today he would believe africa would firstly become politically free and secondly be able to defeat the aids epidemic the final tune of his final album was redemption song one of the most incredible classics of all time dance music not dead says fatboy dj norman cook aka fatboy slim has said that dance music is not dead but has admitted it is currently going through a fallow patch the commercial failure of the latest albums by britains two biggest dance acts fatboy slims palookaville and the prodigys always outnumbered never outgunned has been coupled with the closure of many superclubs and the folding of three dance music magazines last month the brit awards announced they would no longer be awarding a best dance act prize with the brits committee announcing that dance music is no longer where its happening in music these developments lead some to suggest that dance was finished as a popular music genre cook acknowledged that much change in the dance world in the four years since his last album halfway between the gutter and the stars but he stressed this did not mean the dance scene was permanently over every week when i was making the album i was reading articles about the demise of dance music and obviously that affects you somewhat he told bbc world services the ticket programme i personally dont believe its either dead or going to die but its going through a bit of a fallow patch so i think consciously or subconsciously reading every week that dance music was dead i would think right scrub that track then although his album sales in the uk are down palookaville stayed in the uk top for just three weeks cook has achieved recent global success with his beach parties and event on brighton sea front in attracted people while a later one in rio achieved a crowd of the dvd of the rio set was the biggest seller of that year with a crowd that big if the weathers nice the atmosphere before i even go is so good that about halfway through the first record i think ive got them cook said im always really really nervous before the big ones they had to give me valium before rio because two hours before i was literally just pacing the floor for some reason especially now ive got a reputation for it the atmosphere and the joie de vivre thats already going on means all i have to do is play up records he promised more such parties in more locations around the world despite problems after the brighton event which ended in chaos with many revellers finding themselves stranded as transport ground to a halt one man also died of a heart attack and a woman fell to her death during the free party were having to widen our horizons from just beaches because theres landlocked countries that want to get involved cook said were doing rio at the carnival at the maracana and sao paolo our new gig is famous football stadiums the dj admitted however that his massive worldwide success had a downside with intense media interest in his personal life in particular he said he had struggled to cope with tabloid intrusion during the temporary breakup of his marriage to radio one presenter zoe ball after she was linked with dj dan peppe the tabloid thing has been difficult at times cook said especially the meandzoegate its quite scary he said that he had been determined that what had happened with ball did not affect the album at first i was doing deliberately jolly tunes so that people wouldnt think i was depressed he explained then i thought thats not right and he highlighted a bizarre coincidence that one song written before they split had turned out to have a great deal more meaning than intended i said to zoe i did this track called my masochistic baby went and left me do you mind if its on the album he recalled she said yeah its hilarious because your masochistic baby did leave you cook also added that he had some ways of coping with the intense paparazzi pressure which accumulates at the end of the private road he lives on where paul mccartney is a neighbour its almost like prisoners rattling the bars with their mugs cook explained if theres a pap at the end of the road everyone knocks on each others doors paul comes round and we warn him because we dont know who theyre after label withdraws mcfaddens video the new video of former westlife singer brian mcfadden has been pulled after a dublin school complained about being associated with his song irish son st fintians high school says it is clearly identified in the video while mcfadden never went there mcfadden makes claims that he was beaten at his own school in the songs lyrics saying it had cell blocks the performers record label sony bmg has withdrawn the video and issued replacements to television stations the label believed the school name was fictitious until they received the complaint they have said the reference to the school was unintentional and coincidental the head of christian brothers school st fintians richard fogarty said the video implied that the yearold pop star had attended his school and was abused there the school has always treated its pupils with respect mr fogarty said in a statement mcfadden makes specific references to the christian brothers in his song but did not attend st fintians corporal punishment was outlawed in irish schools in when mcfadden was two years old mcfadden whose debut solo album is released next week has said that every song is autobiographical and a true story alcoholism and domestic violence are among the other topics dealt with in his songs half of which have been written with robbie williams former collaborator guy chambers mcfadden who quit charttopping group westlife in march went to number one in september with his first solo single real to me he enjoyed charttoppers with the boy band

three to number five there was more follow up to brits success for franz ferdinand won best rock act and best british group last week their selftitled album moved from to number four last weeks number one album tourist by athlete fell to number three franz man seeks government help franz ferdinand frontman alex kapranos has called for more government help for musicians while taking part in an edinburgh lectures discussion for any cultural output to thrive there needs to be some kind of state input to that as well he said but kapranos warned against musicians being too closely linked with mps at the university of edinburgh event i think the role of musicians is to question politicians rather than to go to bed with them he said kapranos joined the prestigious lecture series to discuss scotlands role in making st century music there are elements of our musical output which require sustenance because they arent selfsufficient he said but socalled commercial music would benefit from investment as well he warned musicians against being allied to a particular party however i dont know if having tea with politicians is always a good idea kapranos and his glasgow fourpiece band have been nominated for five prizes at next weeks brit awards including best group and best album their selftitled debut album won last years mercury music prize and spawned three top singles he told the strong audience at the universitys reid hall that musicians should listen to a wide range of music and should not be restricted by stereotypes we say i like this because i listen to nirvana and korn i am a troubled individual im riddled with angst because i listen to chopin and debussy i listen to kylie minogue and scissor sisters because im upbeat and i like to party i listen to wagner because i like the smell of napalm in the morning kapranos said there was a general hostility towards classical music adding there is very little done to break that hostility other than classic fm he concluded we define ourselves as a nation by the way we encourage our creativity fellow speaker and classical composer james macmillan agreed we need to rediscover our ability to listen previous speakers at the edinburgh lectures series have included former soviet leader mikhail gorbachev and author professor stephen hawking kapranos described his appearance on wednesday as more daunting by a long way than their upcoming brits performance i dont really care about the brits he said its going to be great to go down but i have actually had to exercise part of my brain tonight i think the government should do more to help upandcoming artists be discovered by scrapping the entertainment licences for live venues also they should do more to help independent record labels have a louder voice within an industry dominated by commercialised major labels rather than expecting the government ie the taxpayer to fork out why dont some of the megastars put something back in some of britains wealthiest people are musicians who have raked it in from albums concerts etc there are far more important demands on government funds if they can fund football why not fund music areas of the arts are funded by government and lottery grants so why not music we already have the opera receiving huge grants and it would clearly be beneficial for diversity in music to have the same opportunities in other areas of the music the only problem would be how to judge what merits state cash the government has enough problems funding schools and health services if alex kapranos genuinely thinks a multibillion pound industry should also have government funding then his own education was seriously lacking and more money should be put into that as a scot living in england i appreciate the value of scottish music and culture being a success so i can see no problem with it franz ferdinand travis and snow patrol are just recent examples of the success scottish music can have in the world so we should do what we scots are good at and support our own goods i think the issue is more fundamental should the government be spending money on subsidising a multimillion pound industry when health and education are in such a sorry state the answer is most definitely no those people who are lucky enough to pursue their passion to get their pay cheque shouldnt be looking for government subsidies i know that if i was lucky enough to be able to pursue my dream of show jumping i would want to finance myself until i was in a position to pursue corporate sponsorship yes the government should fund music it brings joy to the masses there are already thousands of statefunded musicians out there sitting around twiddling their thumbs on the new deal getting the government even more involved would only waste money that could be put to better use as long as the government was funding real talent it would be a great move i would hate to see more pop idoltype funding of music though as it would only serve to reinforce the stereotypes that alex talked about only if the proposals make financial sense franz ferdinand must be paying serious amounts of tax on their record sales if theyd had a government grant to get started theyd have more than paid it back by now so the treasury would be making far more than it paid out however the government has better things to spend its money on than to give charity to everyone who decides theyre a musician the government shouldnt fund music it should invest in music and those investments should be treated like any other investment i think the government needs to provide facilities and for young groups and bands to form and practise the equipment is not cheap and can be well beyond the means of many people however i do feel this should be the extent of their role to provide the conditions for the talent to flourish and let it go from there i do agree that the government should help to fund music but there is also a responsibility held by record companies they generally always opt for the tried and tested and tend not to want to break any moulds or risk losing any money which ultimately the directors are in the business for if labels were more willing to put money forward towards smaller breakthrough acts then the government wouldnt have to fork out a great deal yeah why not music should be government funded particularly the work of modern composers and veteran bandsartists and stuff pop music pretty much rules the earth so more attention should go to the other fraternities i agree with funding the arts to make it more accessible to the public but i am not convinced that pop music requires financial support from the taxpayer there is a great deal of money generated through pop music perhaps a tax on pop could be ploughed into the public performance of other forms of music for everyone to enjoy perhaps we could financially penalise really bad pop idolstyle music that is the music industry sector without any artistic merit or originality whatsoever and that which is specifically designed to line the pockets of music producers call it a tax on music pollution if you like though i really like franz ferdinand i have to disagree with mr kapranos once government gets their hand into the private sector it will destroy the creative and possibly controversial avenues the artist pursues many years ago this was the case with the us nea when the government started to question what was considered art for the money they were allotting the solution mr kapranos should pursue would be privatelyfunded organizations like save the music in the us hard act to follow for outkast us rap duo outkasts trio of trophies at the mtv europe awards crowns a year of huge success for the band the latest triumph adds to the three grammys and four american mtv gongs won earlier in this year andre and big bois album speakerboxxxthe love below has been critically acclaimed since its release and sold in large quantities around the world the double album which saw the pair produce one disc each topped the charts in the us at the same time as single hey ya it took another track from the exponents of southern hiphop the way you move to displace it from the top spot the georgia pairs year of critical and commercial triumph leaves them with a tough act to follow what can be next for a musical act that has done it all g money a presenter on the bbcs urban music station xtra thinks a hiatus is inevitable after such a sustained period of exposure giving the band time to think about other interests they might be more appearances outside the band such as producing for other artists while they have a number of fringe music projects andre would like to go into acting so we might see him a film while big boi already has a dogbreeding business says the dj but in a couple of years they will be back with another album which will be a collaboration unlike their double cd their greatness has become clear with speakerboxxxthe love below we havent seen the last of them he adds outkasts musical career spans years and they have enjoyed commercial and critical success in the past with their debut southernplayalisticadillacmuzik going platinum but it took until for the pair to score their first hit in the uk with ms jackson while their album stakonia saw their fame spread beyond the us xtras g money says it took the latest album released in for him to be assured of their genius they have always been experimental some of it has worked and some hasnt he adds but g money acknowledges that making the next move for a band that has reached a pinnacle can be tough what can you do next when youve done it all he says with ten years of success behind them and worldwide fame it seems that outkast is not a name that is likely to be forgotten in a hurry vibe awards back despite violence the us vibe awards will be held again next year despite a stabbing which happened during the ceremony vibe magazine president kenard gibbs said the attack earlier this month in santa monica was sickening he said not holding the awards would be counter to the work the magazine has done to promote hip

ticketing for events if implemented and they were going as far as we can to cut touting as long as its approached in the right way it might really work it might really change the system she said in all tickets for the public sold out in hours they were personalised with the names of purchasers who were asked to bring identification such as a driving licence passport or household bill but some

music online costs the uk music industry millions every year and has been blamed for a decline in worldwide cd sales british music rights bmr which was formed to represent the interests of songwriters and composers worked with education experts to put together a learning pack songwriter guy chambers who has worked with stars including robbie williams has thrown his support behind the scheme he said as well as educating children about music piracy it would also protect young people planning a career in the music industry from unscrupulous individuals at a debate in london to launch the scheme chambers said i think it is important that young people receive practical and engaging learning in schools these lessons will give them an insight into how the creative industries work which will help them in possible future careers the education pack which has already been requested by more than secondary schools is aimed at giving children an understanding of copyright in relation to the music industry it will also teach children about the importance of royalties and raises awareness of different careers in the music industry particularly in the digital age henri yoxall general manager of british music rights told bbc news schools had been crying out for a resource to help them educate pupils about the issues the scheme which is an extension of bmrs respect the value of music campaign is also being backed by singersongwriters feargal sharkey lucie silvas and grammy awardwinning composer david arnold silvas said i think it is so important that students gain an understanding of how

regard to the criminal proceedings before moving forward with the civil action however ms clarkson and her family understand that the fair administration of justice takes time and in light of the numerous changes mr spector has made in his legal defence team over the last two years ms clarkson was forced to file the action before the statute of limitations expired on february mr spector known

news he said they had both seen the scripts and had agreed to appear in an episode each of the sitcom extras they join british stars jude law and kate winslet who have been booked for guest roles the comic and actor said he had drawn up an alist of stars he wanted and all had agreed to be in it we wanted actors who had iconic status but that we could also deconstruct gervais told bbc news its not about the zeitgeist we wanted people who would still be around in years not just the winner of big brother to take part gervais admitted he was cautious about revealing who would be taking part until they had all signed on the dotted line but he has met with stiller and jackson and they enjoyed the scripts enough to commit to it i didnt want to start revealing names until it was all sorted because people just mention people who havent even been asked i have been linked with ridiculous stories recently such as im going to be in a remake of taking dudley moores part i havent been approached and i wouldnt take it anyway he said stiller and jackson would be playing twisted versions of themselves in extras and that the jokes about them would sail pretty close to the bone gervais and his writing partner stephen merchant are currently refining the scripts for the sixpart series in which gervais plays a struggling actor who bitches about the stars meanwhile gervais is gearing up to promote his cartoon book flanimals which is released in the us in march around the same time as nbc begin showing the us version of the office the film rights to flanimals have already been snapped up but gervais is keen for the project to be taken slowly a film will happen over the next three years but i dont want it to be a m movie straight away because it is not well enough known and it wouldnt be another

back on the market broadcaster chris evans has begun selling thousands of his possessions from a stall in camden market london evans perched on a stool as shoppers wandered around the openfronted shop packed with his furniture among the items from his homes in los angeles and london were countless sofas chairs pictures beds and memorabilia from his past tv shows asked the reason for the sale evans said i just want to get rid of it all its just a headache he added it feels good to be selling this stuff its a weight off my mind look at it all theres so much clutter ive enjoyed every bit of furniture and every poster but its not important anymore the normally gregarious evans cut a peculiarly unshowbusinesslike figure as he sipped coffee and smoked cigarettes wrapped in a big coat and scarf in front of his aladdins cave however the ostentation of some of the items on sale painted a picture of the eccentricity that endeared him to the british public in shows such as channel s gameshow dont forget your toothbrush the most striking thing about many of the pieces was their sheer size sofas looked like they could seat a small party and a bed seemed big enough for four the elaborate nature of the pieces many custommade had to be admired particularly a huge red and gold upholstered throne and a stripy deckchair from the queen mary liner to help people in their browsing evans had given the pieces labels with not only the price but a helpful often comic aside isnt it great was the comment on the throne and bob dylans old sofa honest was written on a dark wood couch priced the prices were steep by a lot of peoples standards but evans said it was not deterring shoppers ive sold quite a lot already everything here is on sale for less than i bought it for but its not really about the money its about getting rid of it all weve all been bartering thats what its all about he added that he was not going to reveal what he was going to do with the money he was making vintage tv and film posters also lined the walls including a rare portrait of raquel welch and an original advertising print from the benny hill show and almost hidden at the back of the lockup were the two giant toothbrushes from his former channel show although these were not for sale despite the sheer curiosity value of the sale there was a healthy trickle of interest from the public rather than the perhaps expected crowds some wandered in just to browse as they would any of the other stalls not knowing that it belonged to evans paul burgess said i didnt realise i thought it was just a load of junk i should go back and have a better look but local resident francesca detakats came specially to the stall and left happy with her purchase of an original s photograph of the who by david wedgburg ms detakats said she was a collector and did not mind paying for the print if you like something you dont really count it like that she said martin hellewell who had also made a point of visiting evans shop said he thought it was a great idea why not if youve got stuff to get rid of its a good place to do it said mr hellewell evans has taken out the stall with business partner pete winterbottom they plan to open every day if possible although evans did not know how often he would be there well stay definitely until christmas and then maybe a week after that said evans top stars

gets to the tsunami victims and warned the celebrities taking part had better be involved all the way down the line but clooney accused oreilly of creating a fuss for his own personal gain saying

forensic science thanks to the success of the csi tv shows real experts say evidence submitted to forensic labs has shot up as a result of the programmes at a time when many have large backlogs science investigators claim lawyers also fear the effect because jurors have a distorted view of how forensic evidence is used the issue was discussed at a major science conference in washington dc crime scene investigation csi and its spinoffs csi miami and csi new york have proven exceptionally popular with audiences on both sides of the atlantic each episode a team of forensic investigators goes about solving a crime through the ingenious appliance of science and the extensive resources at their disposal the csi effect is basically the perception of the nearinfallibility of forensic science in response to the tv show said max houck who runs a forensic science graduate course at west virginia university us this tv show comes on and everyone starts watching it including the cops and prosecutors and submissions to forensic laboratories go through the roof he told the annual meeting of the american association for the advancement of science aaas the american forensics expert said there were roughly backlogged dna samples in us labs yet these constituted just of the total test backlog said dr houck forensic pathologist dr patricia mcfeeley said she had started to see the shows influence in dealing with the families of victims what i find is that families now are more dissatisfied with the investigation than was previously the case she explained for example on television the toxicology results are available almost instantaneously but when people find out that it can take several months they can find that very difficult dr mcfeeley added that the accuracy with which forensic investigators can determine time of death was far lower than most peoples perceptions the shows influence can follow forensic investigators all the way into the courtroom making lawyers jittery prosecutors fear the csi effect with juries because for example they wonder why wasnt everything tested well in fact not everything needs to be tested dr houck explained defence attorneys also worry about the csi effect because they think that jurors come in and have this view of science as a juggernaut this objective method thats always accurate however he admitted the show had had positive as well as negative effects on the field my university course started with four graduates in were now the largest major on campus with students he said dr houck added that there was an urgent need for better funding of forensic science at the university level theres more money spent in this country on holistic medicine than there is on forensic science research us tv special for

tuesday after viewing previews of the first five episodes the drama now in its fourth series begins on sunday evening the new series portrays a muslim family as a sleeper terrorist cell the muslim council of britain said in a statement we are greatly concerned by the unremittingly hostile and unbalanced portrayal of muslims in this series of based upon a preview of the first five episodes that we have seen there is not a single positive muslim character in the storyline to date at a time when negative stereotypes of muslims are on the increase we feel that sky as a major uk broadcaster has a responsibility to challenge these insidious views not help to reinforce them but sky denied the programme breached broadcasting guidelines a spokesperson said during a useful meeting yesterday sky listened to the concerns raised by representatives of the council sky does not believe that the episodes that it has reviewed to date breach ofcoms programme code fox tv which shows the series in the

are succeeding thanks to a hugely popular tv show meeting point has become one of tv angolas most watched programmes and has reunited hundreds of families it runs daily not only on the television but also on the radio every friday hundreds of people gather in luandas independence square to record a message in front of the tv cameras in the hope that a lost relative will see it many relatives have been reunited on air at the beginning there was an absolute explosion huge huge crowds sergio gera the programmes chief coordinator told bbc world services assignment programme now things are a little calmer there are slightly less people but after two and a half years of broadcasting there are still a lot of people going the media in the southern african country twice the size of france has been gripped by the quest of so many people to find their relatives hundreds of thousands of people died in angolas year civil war which finally ended in and tens of thousands of people are still missing many have not heard anything for or more years in all of angolan families have lost someone the idea of recording in independence square was modelled on a square in the argentine capital buenos aries where mothers go to talk about the dead and the missing and to exchange news one woman victoria lapete found her sister the only remaining member of her family in independence square live on meeting point she had not seen her sibling for years when we saw each other we threw ourselves into each others arms she told assignment we started to cry i felt very very happy because id spent so long without any family suddenly i had a sister again however angola is one of the poorest countries in africa and the number of people with access to either a television or radio is comparatively few this means that elsewhere in the country the task of reuniting families lies primarily with the international committee of the red cross icrc in the city of wambo the icrc runs the gazetta a page tabloidsize book which contains names of missing or displaced their task is made much harder by the huge number of landmines dotted around the country its very difficult there are many displaced stated joaquim sahundi head of tracing in wambo as they try to go back home others are trying to relocate their relatives many people are getting injured because of that in the villages in the bush there has been no clearance of mines when people are crossing these areas they step on mines the icrc also uses the media where it can running four daily broadcasts of their lists of the missing on radio angola meanwhile there remain massive challenges to angolan families even once they are reunited the programme of family reunification is extremely important but for these families to remain reunified there has to be social integration job access education healthcare said rafael marques of the prodemocracy george soros foundation for southern africa essentially the government is waiting for the international community to pay for the reconstruction thats why it has been persistently calling for a donors conference that is just a way of detaching itself from its political

to place bets on fridays surprise double eviction this is highly unlikely to have been an inspired guess william hill spokesman rupert adams said however a big brother spokeswoman was satisfied that sensitive information about the show remained confidential the bookmaker said its suspicions had been aroused by betting for the last two contestant evictions when people were still trying to place large sums despite odds as short as but william hills overwhelming evidence came on friday when four unknown callers asked to place bets on the shows surprise double eviction shortly afterwards model caprice and actor jeremy edwards left the show mr adams believed someone had gained access to figures which revealed how viewers were voting and was using them to predict which celebrity would be evicted next we think somebody somewhere has got them and has been trying very hard to take us to the cleaners he said the bets were not taken mr adams did not believe anyone from channel or big brother producer endemol had tried to place the queried bets but he added they need to look at how many people are privy to the sensitive information big brothers spokeswoman said only a handful of senior production executives are privy to any sensitive information regarding eviction voting and there are strict procedures in place to keep this information strictly confidential we do not feel the need to investigate this further as we are satisfied that these measures are effective the shows independent adjudicator the electoral reform services was also satisfied she added the current series

thing that seemed to be doing its damndest to avoid any bloody tune we want people to go away from the gigs humming the tunes that we were singing but at the same time bringing an edge to it franz ferdinand had a question they asked themselves every time they wrote a song kapranos said wheres the fun in that they pondered at every stage making enjoyment the top priority and ensuring they did not disappear up their own muso posteriors the band started out with a diy ethic that saw them take over a disused artdeco warehouse in glasgow and rename it the chateau the venue soon became legendary so wellknown that the police spent a month trying to find it eventually raiding it and arresting kapranos but the charges of running an illegal bar and contravening health and safety fire hazard and noise abatement laws were dropped the band took over an abandoned victorian courtroom and jail instead and named that the chateau the buzz about the band soon spread around the music

have become stadiumconquering rock giants since his disappearance but edwards was the figurehead for their first dangerous and dazzling incarnation edwards did not feature in the original lineup of the band though singerguitarist james dean bradfield bassist nicky wire and drummer sean moore were originally accompanied by a rhythm guitarist called flicker but edwards replaced flicker in time for the bands selffinanced debut suicide alley after designing the records artwork after becoming a fulltime member edwards became a critical part of the band writing lyrics and playing guitar though in many concerts he was not actually plugged in but the fiercely intelligent edwards who namechecked writers such as sylvia plath george orwell and philip larkin battled depression alcohol problems eating disorders and selfharm by the time the band released their third album the holy bible in october edwards had been admitted to hospital with depression but in his last interview a few months later seemed to be making plans for the future edwards walks out of the embassy hotel in london in the early morning ahead of the bands us tour to promote the holy bible in the following days police issue a missing person alert and his parents graham and sherry plead for their son to let them know he is safe and well police discover edwards car in a car park near the severn bridge near bristol a

interpol are alerted but do not track him down graham and sherry edwards fly to the spanish island of fuerteventura six weeks after reports a man fitting their sons description has been seen in a bar called underground the report comes to nothing edwards sister rachel makes an emotional tv appeal five years after the disappearance id just like to say to him if he is able to listen that we do love him very much and wed like him to come back me mum and dad she said the band play a concert in the cuban capital havana the first contemporary western rock band to play there on the seventh anniversary of his disappearance police offer edwards parents the opportunity to sign a death certificate they refuse the big issue magazine which supports homelessness charities prints the last known

the bands royalties into an account held in his name mogul wilson backing uk rap band tony wilson the music mogul who established the influential factory records in the s is to launch a new label convinced he has discovered his third major band factory were the label of both joy division who became new order after singer ian curtis committed suicide and the happy mondays now wilson believes rap act raw t signed to his f label the fourth incarnation of factory will complete the hattrick suddenly when raw t came into my life i realised they are my third major band he told bbc world services the music biz programme the group are set to release their first single on february and follow it up with an album realise and witness in march wilson has twice tried to resurrect factory which lasted for years before folding but conceded these efforts had been despondent and dismal experiences but it has not put him off of all the things i do in my life the most exciting thing ive ever done and the thing i have most loved is being part of a record company he added the idea of working with brilliant young musicians and being close to the centre of popular culture is just the biggest thrill in my life wilson explained how his son persuaded him to go and see raw t but he had initially been reluctant saying he detested young british people rapping its always inauthentic its always crass it never really works for me he said i went to see this group raw t which stands for realise and witness talent and like everyone else in the room that night we were utterly blown away wilson believes raw t could be to f as joy division were to factory records the story of factory records which also owned the legendary hacienda club in manchester was told in the michael winterbottom film hour party people in which wilson was played by steve coogan wilson stressed that the independent music scene remained as important as it had been during the s when labels such as factory and rough trade proliferated he pointed out that franz ferdinand and the white stripes perhaps the two most important bands since the millennium were signed to indies i think that is a reflection of how useful and how powerful the indie philosophy is and how bands prefer it he added they can make more money that way its a more generous relationship and also its a more understanding relationship i think independents are in a wonderful position at this moment in time spears seeks aborted tour payment singer britney spears is suing eight insurance companies that have refused to reimburse her for cancelling her world tour the pop star cancelled her onyx hotel tour last june after suffering a knee injury during a video shoot she is now seeking to be reimbursed for the tours m m costs in a claim

the date tour after injuring her knee during a show in illinois last march but she was rushed to hospital and needed surgery after a later incident while filming a video for her song outrageous leading her to cancel the rest of the tour including dates in china she obviously took a wrong step and blew out her knee a jive spokeswoman said at the time it was an old dance injury the legal

spears supported by elaborate costumes complex choreography as well as cuttingedge video production lighting and other effects in september spears married kevin federline who had been a dancer on the aborted tour deal to ban homophobic reggae the reggae industry is to refuse to release or stage concerts featuring homophobic songs under a global deal struck with gay rights groups a damaging

group including outrage the black gay mens advisory group and jamaican movement jflag that coalition has reached a verbal agreement with major dancehall reggae record labels and concert promoters covering eight of the scenes biggest stars but the artists themselves were not involved in the negotiations and have not directly signed up instead the record companies have pledged not to release or rerelease any offensive songs many of which date back a number of years and it is believed promoters will make stars agree not to perform such tunes on stage the reggae industry will work with the artists while still maintaining their freedom of speech and artistic freedom according to media and pr strategist glen yearwood who is representing the reggae industry the industry would halt any attempt by an artist to perform or release a song inciting violence against any group or gender he said well advise them this is not the way forward in a civilised society the stop murder music campaign saw protesters picket gigs resulted in sizzlas uk tour being cancelled in november forced mobo award organisers to drop artists from nominations and saw beenie man dropped from an mtv show in august police have also been investigating whether lyrics incite the assault and murder of gay people the campaign was a blow to the reggae industry mr yearwood admitted if you cant have major stars touring then you dont sell many albums he said but the artists beenie man sizzla elephant man buju banton bounty killer tok capleton and vybz kartel will not have to apologise for past songs or comments outrages mr lock said the main players in the dancehall reggae industry will attempt to regulate the industry themselves to ensure that there arent any violently homophobic or gaybashing lyrics in the future as a gesture of good faith the stop murder music coalition has agreed to suspend our aggressive campaigning against murder music so we shall not be picketing concerts or calling

three brit award nominations the fourpiece leicester band blends dark electronics with rock earning kasabian places on the best british group rock act and live act shortlists they have also earned a reputation as outspoken and charismatic in contrast to fellow brit nominees such as keane and snow patrol british music needs a kick up the arse and britain needs a new band to breathe life into the british people again declared kasabians singer tom meighan noones doing it at the minute music feels like its in the afterlife right now we dont want people to give up on it the serpents going to rise from the sea and scare all the pirates away meighan grew up in leicester with kasabian songwriterguitarist sergio pizzorno and bassist chris edwards a trio which began making music from the age of they enlisted guitarist and keyboard player christopher karloff after spotting him in a pub we saw his long sideburns and thought hey he looks the part well ask him said meighan inspired by britpop and a mutual love of hardcore an early s genre that fused house music with hip hop beats and a dark sensibility they added an electronic element to the traditional guitar sound we got a computer and we cut rocknroll up because theres no point in going back to how it was said meighan its all about new ideas and creativity the bands original approach is reflected in its name inspired by linda kasabian the getaway driver of us serial killer charles manson coincidentally it is also the armenian term for butcher kasabian moved into a remote farmhouse in rutland to record their debut album benefiting from its isolation but also managing to sneak in a few parties while they were there signed to the rca record label kasabian tested the water with two singles club foot and lsf which reached numbers and in the uk singles chart respectively they built up their following on the summer festival circuit opening both glastonbury and t in the park and at a series of guerilla gigs at unusual venues including half time orange a pub next to leicester city football clubs headquarters kasabians selftitled album was released last september to widespread critical acclaim its indie dance stance drawing comparisons to the stone roses primal scream and the happy mondays regarding it as both a fiery assertion of rock n roll ethics and proof that a siege mentality is alive and well in the badlands of rutland water the nmes praise was typical of the albums reception as progressed kasabian would score a further two hits processed beats and cutt off and embark upon a wellreceived uk tour we take our music seriously definitely but we want to have fun with it said pizzorno this is not a job to us added meighan this is the best life we could ever have this is what its all about and without it wed be lost souls but music needs us as well brits debate over urban music joss stone a yearold soul singer from devon beat dizzee rascal jamelia lemar and the streets to win best british urban act at the brit awards her victory has reignited the debate about what urban music is im not really comfortable with the word urban its a word thats been manufactured in this country and america to describe black music the word urban seems to cover such a broad range of black music that its wrong how far are the brits removed from innercity music and what people are doing its so far removed that i dont expect them to get it bang on the music industry isnt championing music from our particular genre very well anyway people dont feel like thats anything to do with us i dont feel like urban musics just been celebrated by joss stone winning or her being nominated or by the brits acknowledging that theres an urban music scene because its all a kick in the teeth at the end of the day its not really relevant if joss stone is the closest thing that they feel comfortable championing because of what she looks like and how she sounds and who shes signed to then so be it its got nothing to do with whats really going on urban as a genre is very broad if you look underneath urban there are a number of core elements that include hiphop rb garage and into that obviously comes soul joss stone is a soul artist her first album was called the soul sessions so urban is a very broad brushstroke that is the umbrella over the top of subgenres and there are offshoots of all of those joss stone has had amazing success in the us given that shes a uk artist what has really captured everybodys imagination is that here you have a yearold from devon with a voice to die for and a bunch of really really good tunes and she looks good i think thats whats done it the award for best british urban act was voted for by viewers of mtv base i dont think joss was not a worthy winner she makes soul music and that definitely comes under the category of what we describe as urban the fact that shes from devon is the interesting thing because most of the music we cover is made in large cities and shes literally rural the great thing about urban music is that theres a big range if there is some sort of root with black music or dance music in britain i think thats where you can call it urban thats where this new subcategory or ubercategory has come from joss stone is certainly not old enough to have had some of the experiences of an older soul singer but you couldnt argue that she was being inauthentic with her emotions it is coming from somewhere genuine it has to come across as real thats the only cutoff point we have here and thats the only way by which we judge people what urban means to us as an organisation is the politically correct term to describe music which originated from a black background music should become inclusive and if we are fighting for a multicultural britain then we should be fighting for inclusion rather than exclusion if joss stone can be accepted within the urban music community i think acts from other ethnicities doing classical music and rock should be accepted too race doesnt make a difference if everyone is included out of all the awards dished out yesterday im still trying to find out what people of other races received any sort of recognition or award a type of music especially street music that originates from a city and typically reflects or is characteristic of urban life she might not be urban but when did rb become the hip hop tainted thing it is now rb stands for rhythm and blues remember that joss stone is rubbish is certain if anyone deserves to win an award for urban music i think probably should include hiphop soul funk at least but not rock or pop this year its the streets although dizzee rascal stakes a good claim she definitely deserved to win a prize joss stones albums are quite simply amazing easily better than anything else that was released last year this whole debate about what is urban what isnt urban is completely pointless and probably fueled by urban artists who werent nominated or didnt win i cant see why people cant just congratulate her for the talent that she is she did deserve it but i agree with the comments about urban music its a stupid phrase and particularly british in the states they tend to use hip hop and rb if i say hip hop here a lot of people have no idea what im talking about very strange whats in a name a rose by any other name etc if people want to call it urban why not if we really analysed it the term dance music is misleading because it doesnt describe everything you can dance to whilst i agree that the term urban is open to interpretation it strikes me as simply weird that joss stone has won urban to me is what i hear being played in parties in the inner cities i live in brixton and have never heard the soul sessions pumping out of of a bass heavy sound system in any parties ive been to good luck to joss stone lets celebrate her victory lets also question why with artists so successful and talented as jamelia lemar kanye west dizzee rascal alicia keys and outkast we didnt see a single black artist on stage collecting an award so what youre saying is that any music that has black heritage is not allowed to be sung by anyone who isnt black and if it is then they shouldnt be acknowledged for it even if theyre pretty dam good at it shes has an amazing voice and won good on her oh but shes not black well lets make her feel real bad about it then how dare she though hang on didnt the socalled public vote on this one this idea of pigeonholing whatever is popular at the time is no different than what was happening in the s and s in relation to what jazz was the media then called anything that had a swinging beat syncopated melody or soulful feeling jazz much to the chagrin of the artists it would mean that blues would be put in the same mould as bebop cool and ragtime all very different styles at that time jazz was and remains such a massively misunderstood term and so what of urban music in truth its a lazy term to categorise music that you dont really understand soul and garage are worlds apart musically marvin gaye v tuff jam but no doubt have their connections if we just let the music speak for itself and not judge the success of an artist by the number of awards won then maybe we can enjoy the music for what it is rather than what it represents i demand a prize for rural music sucks to the cities its way better out here we have hay for one thing excluding her from what has become known as urban music would be as bad as excluding lenny kravitz or hendrix from rock music for being black surely i dont understand the point that ty is making if lemar who makes music which is less soulful than joss work won he might have said nothing btw im black too how can she be urban if she spent most of her life in the devon countryside nonsense i love joss to bits and dont care what her branding is its amazing music full stop stop puting it all in brackets and lets just call it music and lets especially drop the black urban tag nearly all music came from black origin this just sets an example that it is ok to pigeonhole people and their music by their colour surely the point of having an urban music category is simply to acknowledge artists that are making what is historically considered urban music irrelevent of the colour of their skin or where they originate from joss stone is simply singing a certain type of music that can be considered urban in style just as someone from an inner city and indeed not from the usa could sing country music if that person was good at it and authentic in sound would we criticise it being referred to as country music or the artist for representing that style the term urban in reference to a music genre in uk has developed in part from the controversy surrounding the branding of the mobo awards the very term music of black origin has confused and offended many people this is particularly strange given the existence of the asian music awards it appears that the use of black or white in relation to music makes people feel uncomfortable the term urban therefore has been invoked to sidestep the debate of which type of music came first black or white thereby rendering the issue colourblind the result is now a redundant new debate as to what urban also means perhaps we should have created a new term altogether to describe the various strains of soulrnb and hiphop one which does not also mean something else as we have done with crunk urban is just a word thats come about recently to describe black music thats become popular now the word wasnt even in use or common use five of six years ago its just a way of the industry clumping it all together without having to call it black music because some people are oversensitive and might call them racist for it im in a band that has been called urban and i despise the label id hate to think i belonged to any neat marketing niche because thats all it is ever since the music channels and record comapnies tried to fracture what they consider music of black origin these labels have been used to undermine the status of good music into a commodity look at all the tv broadcasters unable to reach young people without condesending they simply play some urban music on the soundtrack as if its some dreadful cheap lift music ignore the labels it is what it is just music as a black man i think i agree with some of the statements at least the statements made by the key executives black people should lead the music they invented we should stop calling a genre meaningless northing is meaningless the real question is would joss stone would have been that successful doing the music she was doing if she were black same thing with streets amy winehouse etc whos ever heard of terri walker or rhian benson they are both times better than joss stone and both of them have won urban music awards and i think mobos but why not brits so what if joss stone won the urban awards her music is great soul and surely that is under the urban banner what if the streets had won would people be whining because mike skinner is white it seems that a lot of the fuss is about race where the real issue should be music and nothing else urban is pc version for saying black music im not doubting ms stones talent but why didnt jamelia or lemar get a brit this reminds me of what happened to craig david and soul ii soul in the past getting nominations are easy to get but picking up a brit seems to be the hardest thing refreshing to see people making reasonable intelligent comments on any topic these days more power to you people you have said it there is music you like and music you dont like who cares what label you put on it that entire category was a mess how can you have people like dizzee rascal up against joss stone its like putting eminem against bob geldof she should have been nominated for best british r b act joss stone deserved to win an award for her talents but i dont think it was very urban of her to sing angels with robbie williams urban is a nonsense term music of black origin well doesnt that include rock music made in the inner cities well almost all bands end up making music in londonmanchester etc and doesnt that make some weird implication that all black people live in cities it doesnt make any sense why does music have to be put into a genre its music you like it or you dont simple as that i play in a heavy metal band we are urban music as far as im concerned we live in cities and spend our working life in an urban environment it therefore directly shapes what we write musically urban seems to be the new name for all styles of black music why it needed a rebrand i dont know as the name is misleading oasis originate from a city and characterise the urban life they know therefore more than fit the term urban yet as theyre a white rock band they wont be described as such joss stone has a fantastic voice and great timing and delivery what other reason do they need to award her the brit all this urban and other such categorisation is just the redtape of the music business and is best ignored yeah she deserved it she is talented urban is a crap meaningless politically correct and probably actually racist marketing term though theres only two kinds of music good and bad row threatens hendrix museum plan proposals to open a museum dedicated to jimi hendrix are flailing because of a row over the home of his late father the rundown house in seattle has already been moved wholesale once and local authorities are now demanding it be moved to another site hendrix supporters hoped to turn the home into a museum for the guitarist the mayor is going to go down as the mayor who destroyed jimi hendrixs house said ray rae marshall of the james marshall hendrix foundation the foundation moved the building in which al hendrix lived between and when the land it was built on was to be developed for housing in now the city of seattle wants its new plot to be used for development giving a deadline of february for the home to be moved mr goldman said the authority had promised the house could remain on its new site and be turned into a memorial and community centre seattle officials said no such deal had been offered we never said you can own this property said john franklin chief of its operations department from our perspective it was a temporary situation we have not threatened to demolish the house weve simply asked that they have to move it now mr goldman is calling for the authority to pay to move the building to seattles central district where hendrix grew up janie hendrix the guitarists stepsister said the family were still hoping the guitarist would be honoured by having a road named after him thats something my father really wanted to see she said it would be nice if we didnt have to fight for everything to get it hendrix was widely considered one of the most important guitarists of his time he died of drug overdose in at the age of rapper kanye wests shrewd soul us hiphop star kanye west who leads the race for this years grammys with nominations rose to prominence by producing songs for artists such as jayz and alicia keys he then emerged from his behindthescenes role to become an artist as well as a producer but his solo career almost ended before it began after a nearfatal car crash left west with his jaw wired shut in the resulting song through the wire became wests first uk hit in april and subsequent album the college dropout became a transatlantic success both critically and commercially west began rapping as a teenager at his chicago school inspired by the beats and rhymes of s pioneers run dmc hiphop producer no id encouraged west to sample old soul and rb hits then revive them with an updated sound an approach that would become his trademark i feel like a lot of the soul thats in those old records that i sample is in me he said so when i hear them and i put them with the drums and i bring them to the new millennium its just like gods doing that im one with them records right there its a blessing leaving his chicago art school after only one year a move which would later inspire the title of his album west began his music career coproducing songs for artists mase and the madd rapper this drew the attention of superstar rapper jayz who signed west up to his rocafella record label to produce numerous artists on his roster wests work gained mainstream recognition when he produced the singles takeover and izzo hova on jayzs own album blueprint incorporating samples of five to one by the doors and the jackson fives i want you back respectively the hits were credited with injecting soul back into hiphop as their success attracted further production work for jayz bonnie clyde and artists such as ludacris stand up and alicia keys you dont know my name west announced plans for a solo album driving home from a latenight los angeles recording session in october he was involved in the car crash that left his jaw fractured in three places anytime i hear about any accident my heart sinks in and i just thank god that im still here he later said that steering wheel could have been two inches further out and that would have been it wests account of the accident sampled chaka khans hit through the fire to become the heart of his completed solo album the college dropout released last year it was by turns smooth humorous and sharp and largely avoided the clichd hiphop preoccupation with guns girls and jewellery through the wire was quickly joined in the uk and us charts by slow jamz on which west collaborated with rapper twista and ray actor jamie foxx the college dropout spawned two further uk hits and a string of award nominations west was shortlisted for grammys including nominations for artist and album of the year and took the best hiphop artist producer and album titles at last years music of black origin mobo awards now a respected rapper and producer in the influential field of hiphop kanye west is unlikely to regret his decision to leave college early us desire to be number one u who have won three prestigious grammy awards for their hit vertigo are stubbornly clinging to their status as one of the biggest bands in the world the most popular groups in the history of rock all have several things in common the music must be inspired and appeal across generations and be distinctive if not always groundbreaking but such success is down to more than music they have to be compelling performers charismatic and intelligent enough to make good decisions and keep their feet on the ground they also have to want it they have to want to be the biggest band ever and not stop wanting it the beatles had it the rolling stones still have it rem hold onto it and queen were it in a catsuit and u have it in spades and keep churning it out their new album how to dismantle an atomic bomb comes years after the schoolfriends got together in dublin and years after the joshua tree cemented their place on the alltime rock alist they may have lost some of the edginess and raw youthful force that propelled them to the top but they have lost none of the desire or ability to craft songs and albums vertigo the first single from the new album went straight into the uk singles chart at number one knocking eminem off the top spot and giving them their th top hit the challenge is to be bigger and bolder and better to make records the whole world will listen to bono recently said drummer larry mullen jr echoed those sentiments were very competitive we want to be on the radio have big singles we dont want to be thought of as a veteran band the band have done everything in their considerable powers to ensure they remain the biggest band in the world according to q magazine editor paul rees this makes them hugely determined and formidable he added they are equally determined to push themselves to make music that continues to stand up as such theyve constantly reinvented and challenged themselves they are perhaps alone as the only rock band that has got better with age the other key ingredient was the fact they were highly organised mr rees said they do everything in the right way the group were born when mullen put an appeal for bandmates on a high school notice board attracting fellow pupils paul hewson bono vocals adam clayton bass david evans the edge guitar and his brother dick dick evans soon dropped out and the fourpiece were known as the feedback and the hype before settling on u by they had won a talent contest and got noticed by a manager paul mcguinness they were brilliant but very coarse mcguinness recently said in a way they were doing exactly what they do now only badly they struggled to attract record company attention later being described as pretty damn average and strange and eerie by scouts who saw them live they released two irelandonly singles which topped the national charts in and leading to a deal with island and their debut album boy the stadiumfilling anthemic sound was us aim from the start and their third album war saw them make the breakthrough on both sides of the atlantic going to number one in the uk and in the us songs like sunday bloody sunday and new years day brought success and an image as a political and spiritual band which bono rejected as a cliche his stage performances which included flagwaving speakerclimbing and drumthrowing earned him a reputation as an electric performer and their appearance at s live aid is widely seen as sealing their global stardom in the joshua tree broke sales records and saw the band reach the height of their powers with hits including where the streets have no name i still havent found what im looking for and with or without you those songs took the bands epic atmospheric sound to a simple powerful and popular pinnacle the end of the decade marked a crucial point for the band they had reached the top but still yearned for new challenges and achievements these came in the form of explorations of different branches of rock and forays into electronic dance music plus wildly extravagant stage shows while still trying to retain their mass appeal the achtung baby album in was followed by zooropa pop and their corresponding stadium tours which featured giant olives flying cars live phone calls to the white house and bonos transformation into alteregos the fly and macphisto he was also building a parallel reputation not always to the pleasure of his bandmates as a campaigner on issues from global debt to aids before the release of how to dismantle an atomic bomb they had sold million albums around the world but they still want more lasting influence of legend charles ray charles who has won a string of posthumous grammy awards belonged to a pioneering generation of artists that had a huge influence on the course of rock and pop music his sound encompassed so many styles blues gospel jazz rock n roll even country and had a real impact on the nascent uk beat and rb scenes compared in stature to elvis presley by some commentators charles songs cast their spell on such s stalwarts as joe cocker steve winwood eric burdon and van morrison his influence has extended to contemporary artists such as norah jones with whom he recently recorded a duet if james brown was the godfather of soul then ray charles was indisputably one of its founding fathers along with sam cooke he was instrumental in bringing together the gospel fervour of the deep south baptist church with the devils music of rb to pave the way for a new generation of soul artists without charles it is hard to imagine the tearstained atlantic rb sound of aretha franklin otis redding or wilson pickett he was also a talented jazz composer arranger and band leader playing at the newport jazz festival and carnegie hall and recording with noted jazz musicians such as milt jackson and david fathead newman unfortunately he also shared another trait common among many jazz artists of the era that of heroin addiction which led to him being arrested in his string of s atlantic rb successes included songs that would be covered by the firstgeneration rock n roll greats including ive got a woman roy orbison elvis presley and hallelujah i love her so eddie cochran after the exuberance of his signature song whatd i say charles turned towards a more poporiented style recording hoagy carmichaels sentimental string ballad georgia on my mind and the upbeat hit the road jack he also won acclaim in the country arena with his interpretations of hank williams standards such as your cheating heart and you win again more than years after its release his abc album modern sounds in country and western music is still regarded as a classic his version of don gibsons i cant stop loving you topped the pop and rb charts in the us in he made a rare foray into protest songs with his album a message from the people on it he took a stand on poverty and civil rights echoing similar recordings of the era from progeny such as stevie wonder james brown curtis mayfield and marvin gaye more than years later he would embrace contemporary production with his album my world which featured hiphop beats although charles claimed at the time not to know what hiphop was among the tributes that poured in from all sections of the music world when charles died aged in june was one from his friend the producer quincy jones who described him as a brother in every sense of the word there will never be another musician who did as much to break down the perceived walls of musical genres as much as ray charles did he said former manfred mann singer paul jones who sang on s hits such as come tomorrow and sha la la said charles was one of his heroes im quite sure my own writing was influenced by him he told bbc news online i would put money on the proposition that ray charles will have an influence on music forever abba reunite for musical premiere the original stars of swedish pop quartet abba have reunited for the home premiere of hit musical mamma mia which is based on the bands songs it is the first time in almost years that the four bjorn ulvaeus benny andersson agnetha faltskog and annifrid lyngstad have met publicly faltskog

the celebrated homecoming alongside swedish artist niklas stromstedt almost all of abbas original songs which have sold more than million records worldwide were written and recorded in english the

indies in download sales a campaign has been launched to help independent labels get their music online and benefit from the growing trend for downloading music the british phonographic industry has identified a lack of independent music available for download we want to ensure that independent repertoire is as successful in the download world as it is in the physical world said bpi chief peter jamieson downloaded singles have now overtaken physical singles in the uk mr jamieson said his organisation was lobbying music service providers which include itunes and napster to urge them to promote independent releases download sales are due to be incorporated into the uk singles chart later this year with downloads shortly to be eligible for the singles chart this is a key commercial

pistols queen muse manic street preachers and the clash complete the top a mix of heavy metal punk glam rock and even dance music makes up the list motorhead judas priest and prodigy are included along with newer acts like the darkness and lostprophets kerrang editor ashley bird said its amazing to see so many incredible homegrown albums in one list and without any of the abysmal fashion bands that currently clog up the music scene these are the real opinions of proper rock fans formed by four teenage friends in the west midlands in the late s black sabbath are one of britains most successful heavy rock bands their debut was a uk top hit in and sold more than a million copies in the us osbourne said the bands success in the kerrang poll was a triumph for british rock he said back then youd hear if you go to san francisco be sure to wear a flower in your hair we lived in aston birmingham the only flowers i ever saw were on a gravestone in our local cemetery despite being disliked by many critics black sabbaths subsequent albums included multimillion sellers but internal rows led to osbourne leaving in the band continued without osbourne who went on to solo success but also had to battle alcoholism and legal action over his music allegedly inciting teenagers to commit suicide he was eventually cleared of the charges osbourne who bit off the head of a live bat on stage in rejoined the band to play the live aid charity concert in after many changes in lineup the original four members reunited to play live dates in black sabbath have reunited regularly in recent years while osbourne has gone on to wider fame with his family through mtv documentary series the osbournes michael film signals retirement singer george michael has said that a new film about his life is the start of a retirement from public view the pop star said it would be a much more behind the scenes affair and called his own genre of music dead i thought i should explain myself before i disappear said michael who was at the berlin film festival to launch the documentary the film a different story chronicles michaels life and career from the s and his personal struggles the yearold charttopper told reporters in the german capital that he wanted to move his career into a different form but added that he does not know what it is going to be yet im still going to be making music he said but added that he was not going to be around he hinted at discontent with the current state of music industry and said i dont really think that there is anyone in the modern pop business who i feel i want to spar with michael said that the film directed by southan morris would put his two decades of fame into context its almost as much for me as for my fans in terms of trying to make sense of the last years and bring it to a close in a proper way he said the documentary chronicles the highs and lows of his life in the public gaze from his meteoric rise as one half of pop duo wham to his arrest for lewd conduct in a los angeles toilet in the film also deals with the loss of michaels partner anselmo feleppa from an aidsrelated condition in a different story which is being shown at the berlin film festival has been screened by bbc one hendrix guitar fetches a muchloved guitar belonging to jimi hendrix has been sold for at an auction in london the fender stratocaster was one of a number of guitars included in the sale dedicated to the rock legend the vast archive of instruments signed records and posters were collected by a dedicated fan who had become friendly with the star the auction was billed as the biggest collection of hendrix memorabilia to go under the hammer the majority of the items were collected by fan bob terry who began collecting at the age of he later sold it on to another collector hendrix widely considered one of the best guitarists of his era died of a drug overdose in at the age of the fender stratocaster was used by the musician on tour and in his studio a poem written by hendrix two weeks after his infamous appearance at the monterey festival where he set light to his guitar went for the jimi hendrix experiences first single hey joe signed by all the band was sold for the sale hosted by auctioneers cooper owen was held at the hard rock cafe in london german music in a zombie state the german music business the third largest in the world is in the state of a zombie because it has failed to respond to the challenge posed by downloading and piracy a leading industry figure has said tim renner the head of universal music germany until last year told bbc world services the music biz programme that the countrys music industry was now struggling to survive renner warned that unless the industry accepted new realties such as downloading its decline could become irreversible the problem the music industry has got is that they arent willing to accept that the classic way of doing business is over and out he stated so the music industry in its current form over here is pretty much in the state of a zombie the music market in germany peaked in with sales of bn euros bn since sales have plummeted to just bn euros bn in in the space of one year between and cd album sales fell by but a study by the society for consumer research found that at the same time more than twice as many recordable cds had music recorded on them than cd albums were sold mr renner pointed out that because profit comes mainly from the longevity of a goodselling record this was particularly damaging you need time he added however peter zombic the managing director of the international federation of phonographic industry in germany said he did not feel the situation was as dramatic as mr renner believed its quite true that we have severe problems in germany but thats true in other parts of the world and in most developed markets too he argued we have a severe problem with piracy especially internet piracy and we also have a severe problem of private copying i dont agree that the music industry lost control over the music market in fact especially in regard to germany talent the market is quite successful he did however admit that copyright owners have partly lost control of their copyright due to piracy and copying but he refuted suggestions that the industry had been too slow to respond to digital downloading we were the first to implement a download service back in he argued at that time it was not successful because of the advent of piracy it was the napster time when pp services became popular it still is quite difficult for the music industry to compete with a price that is zero as far as the illegal product is concerned mr zombic also called for a change to the perception in germany that private copying of music is not a problem german law does allow people to make copies of cds for their family and close friends without fear of breaking copyright mr zombic said that this legal framework was a huge problem there is a widespread attitude that private copying is a hobby its nice its fun he added we try to make clear its not nice and its not fun its endangering the creativity in our country

at a london hotel they are next due in court on april the sound of music is coming home the original stage production of the sound of music is to be performed for the first time in the austrian capital years after the film was released the first fullscale theatrical production of the musical will make its debut in vienna on saturday julie andrews starred in the film version of the rogers and hammerstein classic set in the alpine country but despite being one of the most successful musicals of all time it is barely known inside austria the film was never shown in any cinema in austria and was not broadcast on television until the early s the musical is based on the true story of the von trapp family who formed a singing troupe and escaped from nazioccupied austria in sensitivities about nazism during wartime austria and issues towards the von trapp family themselves could explain austrias reluctance to embrace the musical another source of irritation for austrians is the song edelweiss which is considered an traditional folk song by many filmgoers the song was actually an invention by rodgers and hammerstein many also consider the film to portray a kitsch image of austria including yodelling goatherds and lederhosen the production is being staged at a viennese opera house the volksoper beginning on saturday maria the novice nun who falls in love with baron von trapp will be played by austroaustralian actress and singer sandra pires rapper films music video in jail a us rapper awaiting trial for murder has filmed part of a music video in jail angering a sheriff who says he was tricked into letting tv crews in cmurder a former member of rap group tru was filmed in his orange prison suit for the video for his yall heard of me single in a new orleans jail he is awaiting a second trial after an original conviction was thrown out im not pleased jefferson parish sheriff harry lee said he will not make another video in my jail footage for the video was filmed by two crews who had permission to interview cmurder one from court tv and one from a local cable show but mr lee said he did not know the rapper had filmed the video and made an album behind bars and said he was fooled into letting the cameras in the rappers lawyer ron rakosky said the bottom line is we didnt do anything wrong mr rakosky said it was better than cmurder real name corey miller just sitting there wasting away heres a guy in jail making constructive use of his time instead of withering away he said hes lost more than three years of his life locked up for a crime he did not commit but local group victims and citizens against crime said he should not be working behind bars he is a suspect in a murder case i dont think he should be allowed these privileges especially earning money until his name is totally cleared the groups president beverly siemssen said in cmurder was found guilty of killing a yearold in a nightclub but that decision was thrown out last april he is now facing a second trial on a charge of seconddegree murder with two brothers in the group tru he had two us top albums in the late s before going solo when he scored another three top albums music man to the oscars bill contis job of musical director of the oscars show is not for the fainthearted since conducting the orchestra is the ultimate platespinning assignment this year marks contis th turn at the helm of the academy awards orchestra the excitement is a live performance as a musician he says all of your colleagues everyone in the film industry is in the theatre all the important people i guess its just a television show but we always think its a bit more the orchestra strikes up more than times during the average oscars show as well as playing the presenters and winners on and off stage it also performs during the commercial breaks to entertain the live audience in the house its a very busy evening it takes a certain amount of preparation of music orchestrating sketching rehearsing before the show but you dont know what the unexpected will be and as the musical director its exciting explains conti and much of the preparation goes into mastering scores that will never be performed we dont know who the winners will be so when they say the winner is we have five different pieces of music in front of us they say the name we play the appropriate one immediately adds conti the orchestra is often called upon to play when the winners ramble on too long during their acceptance speeches despite being told to be brief by the shows producers the decision to drown out or kill the offending star with music is relayed from the directors box to the orchestra via contis earpiece i dont feel good about it at all its not my call though he says when the director says music the orchestra plays and he takes a long shot of the hall we dont usually see the person speaking while his microphone is cut off the person thats been cut off whos feet from me is glaring at me like its death time on occasions some stars have taken it upon themselves to send a warning shot across the bows of the musical director before they start to speak julia roberts when she came on she asked me to not get ready to play because she had so much to do he says conti received an oscar in for the original score of the right stuff he also received two nominations in the original song category in for gonna fly now from rocky and in for the title song from for your eyes only its a moment in the sun he says when people get up there some people this is hard to believe people that spend their lives in front of the camera or audiences entertaining might get a little flustered but theres this moment in time when the biggest award that they could possibly get in their life has been handed to them and theyre either not in control or they want to thank everyone that they ever met the image of the oscars telecast is one of slick presentation and smooth transitions between performances and the award categories behind the scenes the key players such as conti have a bewildering array of technical props to deal with theres a big script and video monitors you have to watch and there are also audio controls i can control hearing in my ears the left ear or the right ear different things at different times i have to communicate with the director i have a little microphone thats attached to my headset to open up that microphone i have a footswitch he explains contis most nervewracking moment came during his first oscars show as musical director in when a member of the orchestra alerted him that they could smell smoke conti immediately told the shows director i start cursing and screaming i tell him were not going to die for this show you must do something or im going to climb out of this pit with musicians and were going to be home in minutes oh no bill dont do anything came the response imagine these elegantly dressed ladies and gentlemen of the orchestra or so of them in the pit and while were playing firemen with their helmets and their hatchets crawling among us trying to find the reason for the smoke the smell turned out to be new paint smouldering on the music stands no one died its not a big story but it was scary at the time laughs conti when the ceremony is over the music director attends the annual governors ball with his family i have a drink and relive the show he says im not for too much carousing i go home and unwind it takes me about a day church urges nelly show boycott church ministers are trying to prevent rapper nelly performing in arkansas saying they do not want his vile and filthy lyrics in their town more than jonesboro ministers urged music fans to boycott nellys march concert at arkansas state university in a bid to have it cancelled jonesboro is a wonderful city because of what does not come here said the reverend adrian rodgers but a venue spokesman said more than tickets had been sold so far mr rodgers of the fullness of joy church said he was concerned about the rappers lyrics that include references to drugs sex and violence and songs that the minister said were demeaning to women ministers were worried that bringing such acts to jonesboro would lead to problems tear the tickets up mr rodgers said do not go and do not allow your children to go tim dean director of the arkansas state university venue said ticket sales had been brisk it would appear that with ticket sales over many others have expressed their right to find nellys music entertaining and worth spending their time and money on he said nelly has sold more than million singles and albums worldwide and in september simultaneously occupied the number one and two positions in the us albums chart he has had uk hit singles including hot in herre dilemma and recent number one over and over rap feud in cents gunit crew us rap star cent has said he has thrown protege the game out of his gunit gang in a feud that has apparently involved two shootings in a radio interview on monday cent said the newcomer was disloyal in conflicts with other rappers a man was shot in the thigh outside new yorks hot studios while cent was on air more shots were fired outside his management offices two hours later cent appeared on the games debut album which was number one in the us cent whose second album is about to be released after his debut

hottest new star on the rap scene both were drug dealers and were shot before turning to music in an interview with hot on saturday the game described some of cents rivals as my friends and said he would not turn on them nas is one of my friends and jadas really a homie he said s beef is s beef and i really dont know where all this stems from when cent appeared on the same station two days later he said the game was no longer a member of gunit every record hes selling is based on me being on his record with him he said when the shooting took place outside the studio the interview was ended and the rapper was escorted out of the building by security personnel an unidentified yearold los angeles man is stable with a gunshot wound to the upper thigh police say the games associates may have heard the interview and gone to the studio where they confronted cents entourage officers are also investigating a later shooting in which eight bullets were fired into the door of cents management company violator no arrests have been made in relation to either incident cents second album the massacre is released on thursday five weeks after the games debut documentary went to number one elliott wilson editorinchief of hiphop magazine xxl said the feud would boost publicity for cents release it helps him obviously in terms of exposure you cant ask for better promotion he said but he added i think hes making more and more enemies you definitely feel like is he doing too much of a tupac spiral like me against the world you bring more people wanting to see you fail tupac shakur was shot dead in dj double act revamp chart show dj duo jk and joel are taking over bbc radio s flagship chart show on sunday adding showbiz news celebrity interviews and betweensong banter they hope to boost ratings for the longrunning show which has been overtaken in popularity by independent radios hit uk rundown radio s chart show is an institution and remains the stations single most popular show says jk also known as jason king for years people have been tuning in at four oclock with their tape recorders ready to record their favourite tunes not that i ever did that but things have moved on a lot now so it was time for a change that change involved ejecting previous host wes butters and relocating king and dj partner joel ross from their weekend afternoon radio slot the pair have worked together for a decade meeting on viking radio in hull before moving to manchester station key and winning two sony radio awards they also presented gadget series playboyz and car show motor maniacs for cable tv channel granada men and motors and pure soap on bbc three on the revamped chart show their cheeky laddish banter will punctuate star interviews and competitions film and dvd charts plus a look at future single releases in addition to the singles chart itself the chart rundown is no longer the only point of the programme says ross the show used to be the only way to discover who was in the top now you can just click on the internet to find that out so the show has plenty of extra items too the shows reduced reliance upon the top also reflects the fact that music fans are now more likely to download songs in digital format rather than buy them on compact disc vinyl or cassette i personally buy downloads rather than cd singles says yearold ross even my grandma can download songs now jk is still struggling with the technology though but its premature for people to say that the singles chart is dead ross adds while sales of singles on traditional formats are down interest in songs has been revived by download sales which will be incorporated into our main chart rundown from april music fans still want to know what is the most popular song of the week ross will be plumping for chart success from rapper verbalicious and the stereophonics on sunday while king is more of an rb and dance music fan so listeners will get the advantage of both our music tastes says king who describes outgoing host butters as an extremely professional and competent broadcaster the advantage joel and i have is that were a double act with a rapport between us that makes the show much more interactive king says wes has a great broadcasting career ahead of him and if not i could always use a cleaner he jokes ross says the pair have done their best to ignore the weight of expectation placed upon the revamped show other people can worry about that we are going to continue doing what we do well he says at the end of the day this is a radio show that is meant to be entertaining nobody died rem announce new glasgow concert us band rem have announced plans to perform for scottish fans in a rescheduled gig the band will play in what has been dubbed europes biggest

go on sale to the public musicians to tackle us red tape musicians groups are to tackle us visa regulations which are blamed for hindering british acts chances of succeeding across the atlantic a singer hoping to perform in the us can expect to pay simply for obtaining a visa groups including the musicians union are calling for an end to the raw deal faced by british performers us acts are not faced with comparable expense and bureaucracy when visiting the uk for promotional purposes nigel mccune from the musicians union said british musicians are disadvantaged compared to their us counterparts a sponsor has to make a petition on their behalf which is a form amounting to nearly pages while musicians face tougher regulations than athletes and journalists if you make a mistake on your form you risk a fiveyear ban and thus the ability to further your career says mr mccune the us is the worlds biggest music market which means something has to be done about the creaky bureaucracy says mr mccune the current situation is preventing british acts from maintaining momentum and developing in the us he added the musicians union stance is being endorsed by the music managers forum mmf who say british artists face an uphill struggle to succeed in the us thanks to the tough visa requirements which are also seen as impractical the mmfs general secretary james seller said imagine if you were an orchestra from the orkneys every member would have to travel to london to have their visas processed the us market is seen as the holy grail and one of the benchmarks of success and were still going to fight to get in there its still very important but there are other markets like europe india and china added mr seller a department for media culture and sport spokeswoman said were aware that people are experiencing problems and are working with the us embassy and record industry to see what we can do about it a us embassy spokesman said we are aware that entertainers require visas for timespecific visas and are doing everything we can to process those applications speedily we are aware of the importance of cultural exchange and we will do our best to facilitate that he

boys playing billy are james lomas george maguire and liam mower the other major child parts will also be rotated between young actors such are the demands of the show that producers set up a stage

the warrior poet marking a growing trend for nonindian stars to appear in bollywood films directed by bollywood veteran subhash ghai the film is set in the british raj and bernath plays an army generals daughter who falls in love with a rural boy kisna i liked the fluid nature of filmmaking we improvised quite a lot says bernath at times it felt very chaotic but mr ghai was quite clear about what he wanted picked from more than girls in an audition in london bernath cut short her education at bristols old vic theatre school to take up the opportunity it is not often that somebody gets to play the lead role straight out of a drama school she spent three weeks learning hindi and taking dance lessons initially i was a bit sceptical about how people would respond to me bernath says but i found the hindi film industry very warm and encouraging i even had a few offers before the work on kisna was completed films are one of indias biggest exports and those like lagaan and monsoon wedding have broken the traditional boundaries of colour and culture spurred by this bollywood producers are trying to go global in all aspects of filmmaking be it technical or artistic from young heartthrobs

the english print shortened by an hour to accommodate the western audience the film even has a song composed in english by ar rahman the director of the popular west end musical bombay dreams identification is a popular cinematic device use of european or american actors can be viewed as a step in that direction says adarsh the cast of kisna also includes british actors michael maloney caroline langrishe and polly adams another actress annabelle wallace plays the lead role in a bilingual romantic comedy dil jo bhi kahey whatever the heart says which also stars indian screen legend

screen daily has said twentyseven british films were made in the uk last year following a drop in funding compared with in according to the trade weekly it attributed the drop to tighter tax laws and reduced funding from sources such as the national lottery uk and us coproductions in britain fell from in to last year last year the government closed tax loopholes that many film investors had taken advantage of to fund films in the uk several projects were shelved as they faced the implications of this clampdown coupled with the reduction in movie funding from traditional sources including the lottery and miramax films shooting on period drama tulip fever which was to star jude law and keira knightley was postponed indefinitely while shooting of the libertine starring johnny depp was moved to the isle of man there isnt anything coming in to replace the funds said the libertines executive producer marc samuelson we are in a hiatus films with medium budgets of up to m a similar level to box office hits vera drake calendar girls and enduring love are expected to be worst hit by the tax clampdown the strength of the pound against the dollar is expected to have resulted in a fall in the number of us films shot in the uk during screen international added big budget coproductions such as the harry potter series continued to be shot in the uk however the uk film council said the drop was partly due to being an especially good year for british film production when bridget jones the edge of reason wimbledon and thunderbirds were all filmed in the uk the drop was expected as there was no way s record level of production could be bettered the councils spokesperson said the reduction in indigenous film production in was due to a variety of factors including the continuing longterm trend towards coproduction of films in more than one country and changes to financing arrangements it was too early to predict whether the downward trend in uk production would continue throughout the uk film council said in september the government introduced subsidies worth up to m per film for medium budget films under new treasury measures it is also due to announce a replacement

international film festival have been determined to carry on with this years event despite the ravages of the asian tsunami disaster the festivities have been scaled down red carpets have been mothballed and profits from ticket sales are being donated to the tsunami relief fund apart from this however the festival has continued as originally planned when the disaster happened we naturally asked ourselves if we should cancel said the festivals executive director craig prater the decision was made that we would continue but that the focus would change our premieres became fundraisers the opening night was visibly toned down and of every ticket sold goes to the disaster fund he continued but we feel like weve turned a page weve acknowledged our position and now its business as usual mr praters sentiments were echoed by christine rush director of the festivals sister event the bangkok film market we have been careful to be respectful of the thai nations recovery from this terrible disaster she said however the nations recovery very much depends upon it continuing its economic life we are encouraging attendees to keep the victims in mind and aggressively support the aid organisations helping out she added given the conspicuously low audience figures that support may be more symbolic than significant however poor ticket sales have less to do with any fallout from the disaster and more to do with administrative and promotional difficulties the eclectic programme contains a wide range of titles including such oscar hopefuls as ray charles biopic ray and mike leighs abortion drama vera drake that said the absence of thai subtitles on most film prints might have proved offputting to local cinemagoers on a more positive note the celebrity guests attending the event have generated huge media interest in this busy capital city problems securing air transport the clash with last sundays golden globes ceremony in los angeles and other factors have forced some big names to cancel but the festival has still attracted such hollywood directors as oliver stone and joel schumacher alongside such screen stars as michael douglas jeremy irons and jeanclaude van damme irons whose film being julia is in competition for the festivals golden kinnaree awards said he had wondered whether he should attend after decembers catastrophe i questioned whether i should come when such a tragedy had happened the british actor said i thought it might be in rather bad taste but then i spoke to the organisers and i was encouraged to let life go on now ive come here im very

films director marc forster he has two children of his own with french singer vanessa paradis having previously been in a longterm relationship with british model kate moss the theme of childrens literature in depps career and his long association with tim burton are set to continue in his next role playing willy wonka in a remake of roald dahls classic charlie and the chocolate factory

nominated for best actress for her role in the abortion drama while leigh received nods for best director and original screenplay kate winslet was also nominated in the best actress category for her role in eternal sunshine of the spotless mind and clive owen and sophie okonedo both got nominated for supporting roles in closer and hotel rwanda respectively owen has already been made bookmakers favourite for best supporting actor for the role in closer that has already clinched him a golden globe award and it is the first nomination for actress okonedo chosen for her performance in hotel rwanda about the rwandan genocide it is also a debut nomination for staunton who told bbc news she had not thought the film would appeal to academy voters it was an extraordinary time making the film and i cant believe what has happened this morning she said i hope it just shows mike up to be the extraordinary filmmaker he is we are also dealing with a very difficult subject matter and it is amazing to have it accepted in this way leigh who had previously received three oscar nominations for secrets and lies and topsy turvy told bbc news the latest success was amazing he said we hoped that imelda staunton would get a nomination but i never expected to get director and screenplay its just absolutely wonderful i think people are aware that its about life and i hope it is the warmth and compassion that really talks to people winslet said she was ecstatic about the fourth nomination of her career being nominated means so much to me to be nominated for a film that was released a while ago i feel so honoured and overwhelmed she said john woodward chief executive of the uk film council said it was extremely heartening to see british filmmaking talent recognised on the global stage britain has a hugely talented industry and these nominations show why national lottery investment in film pays major dividends for our culture and economy among a total of british nominees composer andrew lloyd webber and lyricist charles hart are up for best original song for learn to be lonely from the phantom of the opera movie cinematographer john mathieson who was nominated for gladiator in is also up for the phantom of the opera and finding neverland has garnered two more nominations for brits gemma jackson who has also worked on bridget joness diary and iris is up for art direction while costume designer alexandra byrne whose previous films have included captain corellis mandolin and elizabeth is in the running the uk has two contenders in the best live action short film category wasp was made by exchildrens tv presenter andrea arnold while little terrorist is the work of ashvin kumar this years awards will be handed out in hollywood on february bening makes awards breakthrough film actress annette bening is up for an oscar for her starring role in the awardwinning film being julia bening who was born in texas in has gained prominence for a string of key roles although an oscar has so far eluded her her status as one of hollywoods favourite actresses remains solid one of the biggest oscars buzzes in recent years was for benings role as troubled carolyn burnham in s american beauty but her deliciously neurotic portrayal of surburban life turning sour was overlooked in favour of hilary swanks leading role in boys dont cry after opening her career in the theatre and gaining a tony award nomination in bening had a lowkey spell in television she then made her film debut as a sexstarved wife in s the great outdoors opposite comics dan akroyd and john candy following a cameo in postcards from the edge benings breakthrough role came in playing seductive con artist myra langtry in the grifters a role that won her an oscar nomination despite some rave reviews bening did not win the best supporting actress academy award however the highprofile performance enabled bening to capture roles in a number of big budget hollywood productions costarring with some of hollywoods greatest players including robert de niro and harrison ford but it was her role opposite warren beatty in gangster flick bugsy which had the greatest impact bening played virginia hill another role which won her high critical acclaim but the film only picked up two of a staggering oscar nominations bugsy was the start of a very significant liaison for bening she married beatty with whom she had a child as the couple promoted the film in europe the couple now have four children together a pair of contrasting yet successful performances peppered benings career in the mids she played michael douglas opposite number in romantic comedy the american president and as a fiery queen elizabeth i in a contemporary adaptation of shakespeares richard iii bening was the first choice to play the female lead in american beauty director sam mendes film debut which was a critical and commercial success but the actress had to be content with a bafta award for her strong performance but current film being julia has made bening an awardwinning actress rather than the perennial nominee with success at the golden globes the witty tale of revenge and love set in s london sees the eponymous theatrical diva played by bening grow tired of her success and fall for a young american and could be the role which finally wins her the coveted academy award oscars steer clear of controversy the oscars nominations list has left out some of the most controversial films of the past year in favour of safer less contentious cinema if best film nominees were drawn on the basis of column inches two of the frontrunners would have had to be michael moores bushbaiting documentary fahrenheit and mel gibsons the passion of the christ both films polarised opinion but had critics talking and the public turning up to see them fahrenheit breaking us box office records for a documentary and the passion of the christ making more than usm m in the us alone but this years academy awards have shied away from the big name controversies with the passion of the christ a film accused of being antisemitic receiving nominations only in the minor categories of cinematography makeup and musical score fahrenheit has also been overlooked despite winning the palme dor at the cannes international film festival in moores caustic documentary may have been affected by its distributors decision to enter it in the best picture category rather than best documentary says tim dams the news editor of trade magazine screen international but he also believes the strong political viewpoint of moores film does not sit well with the academy if you look at past oscar winners and nominees the very conservative oscar voters tend to go for very conservative epicstyle pictures fahrenheit didnt really fit in to that category they tend to go for films like titanic gladiator and the lord of the rings films with scale that often arent too contentious he said while he said the oscar voting panel were not snubbing moores film he thought it was unlikely a documentary could ever seriously compete in a best film category i think its more a misjudgement by the people putting it out rather than a deliberate snub he said the problem with mel gibsons film he believed was that the voting panel may have been cautious in nominating a film with dialogue in aramaic an ancient middle eastern language hollywood doesnt tend to like foreignlanguage films noones ever tried doing a film in a dead language he said but aside from these two films some potentially contentious pictures have won nominations the german film the downfall a biopic tracing the final days of nazi leader adolf hitler in his berlin bunker has been recognised in the best foreign film category the film has caused some controversy in showing hitler as a fallible but human man rather than a semimythical historical monster but mr dams said its not an inflammatory film it has done very well in germany and its a film that portrays hitler as a human rather than some kind of devil or monster another contentious film mr dams said has gained a nomination in the best documentary section through the force of its charm independent filmmaker morgan spurlock may have forced fastfood giant mcdonalds to withdraw its super size portions in the us after he went on a monthlong diet eating nothing but mcdonalds meals and filmed his progress the film has been a hit around the world mr dams said its a political film but its quite fun and punky and wellpaced morgan spurlock is a really likeable guy its a very accessible film and it doesnt beat you over the head with its views while in fahrenheit there are moments of comedy i think the way that super size me is put together the fact its a very likeable film means its won through on charm dams pick at this years oscars the aviator martin scorseses biopic of aviation pioneer and hollywood player howard hughes tinseltown it seems likes nothing more than a picture about one of its own kidman wins photographer battle actress nicole kidman has won a restraining order against two paparazzi photographers who she claims left her fearful of leaving her sydney mansion the oscarwinning star took action against jamie fawcett and ben mcdonald after a bugging device was found outside her home earlier this week lawyers for the pair denied allegations they had planted the device the australian actress is currently in sydney to film her latest movie eucalyptus with russell crowe kidman was prompted to take action following a reported highspeed car chase with members of the paparazzi in sydney last weekend according to local newspaper the daily telegraph the incident involved paparazzi driving through red lights and on the wrong side of the road in pursuit of kidmans vehicle lawyers for mr fawcett and mr mcdonald denied that the pair were involved in the chase kidman sought the apprehended violence orders normally used in australia in cases of domestic violence and similar incidents after being advised to do so by local police nicole would like to make it clear that she acknowledges she is a public figure and that reporters and photographers have a job to do and she respects that said kidmans publicist wendy day however these are specific actions against two individuals who over a period of time have caused her to feel threatened intimidated and unable to leave her home without fearing for her safety magistrate lee gilmore who issued the restraining order at waverley local court in sydney said she understood the photographers were entitled to earn a living but there had to be limits to their behaviour miss kidman says shes willing to put up with some of it but its gone beyond that she said i do believe the allegation in relation to the driving is a serious issue actor scott is new bond favourite bookmaker william hill has stopped taking bets on who will be the next james bond following a succession of large wagers on actor dougray scott the firm closed the book on friday saying insider information could have contributed to the number of bets in the past gambles like this have often been right

than their male counterparts despite being better qualified according to a study released on wednesday only of women earn more than compared with of men women make up a third of the workforce the research was carried out jointly by the uk film council and industry training body skillset it also found that women in the industry were less likely than men to be married or have dependant children the study which claims to be the most indepth so far conducted found of women in the film industry hold degrees compared with of men whilst of men in the industry had no qualifications this was true for only five per cent of women in the lower salary bracket of women earn less than a year compared to only of men the research found very few women worked in the camera sound electrical and construction departments but they made up a majority of those working in makeup and hairdressing uk film council chief executive john woodward said whilst the uk has benefited hugely from its highlyqualified film production workforce there are still many barriers facing people who want to get in and stay in the industry developing the film production workforce must be underpinned with a commitment to diversity as well as training the workforce is largely focused around london with in the industry based in the capital and the south east of england the industry depends heavily on word of mouth with being recruited in that way in total only five percent of the workforce is made up of ethnic minorities although in london the figure rises to the necessity of completing unpaid work experience to get into the workforce has also shot up from before the s to after vera drakes bafta triumph hope at the bafta film awards on saturday night there is the prospect that a homegrown movie could walk off with a clutch of trophies vera drake mike leighs tale about a s backstreet abortionist is nominated in categories these include best film best director and best actress shortlist for imelda staunton who plays the eponymous character the film has spent months being lauded with prizes from the venice film festival to five awards from the london critics circle on wednesday night the baftas has a tradition of honouring british cinema and this year vera drake is the obvious candidate to be heaped with praise empire magazines reviews editor dan jolin said the film had a very good chance of doing well on saturday predicting that it would collect five or six awards i dont think its going to do a lord of the ringsstyle sweep but imelda staunton is a shooin for best actress he said a best director prize for mike leigh and best british film are also likely and it could steal some awards from heavilynominated competitors the aviator and finding neverland mr jolin tipped another contender most likely the aviator to walk away with the bafta for best film and added that finding neverland had been lavished with nominations but not trophies strong oscar contenders million dollar baby and sideways did not figure in the bafta nominations giving vera drake greater potential to walk away with the big prizes there is a sense that this film is ours and we should slap our own guys on the back out of all the films in the running for the baftas vera drake is the true blue british one if mike leigh is going to win awards for anything it should be vera drake at this years baftas said mr jolin adding that the film was probably his most technically accomplished and lavish work yet mr jolin also tipped phil davis for a best supporting actor prize for his role in vera drake but felt that heather craney could be outdone by kate winslet or natalie portman in the supporting actress category if there is anywhere where this film is going to win it will be at the baftas he said the guardians film critic peter bradshaw felt that there might well be a sweep of awards for vera drake on saturday night i hope that bafta voters will respond to the extremely high standard of acting from the whole cast of the film if bafta cant do so what hope is there he said mr bradshaw felt that mike leighs masterpiece was entitled to the best film award leaving dead mans shoes harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban my summer of love and shaun of the dead to slug it out for the best british film trophy i will be cheering if vera drake wins a whole host of awards he added roundabout continues nostalgia trip the new bigscreen version of the magic roundabout released in the uk on friday is the latest attempt to turn childrens television into boxoffice gold recent years have seen a lessthansuccessful adaptation of the s puppet show thunderbirds and a moderately successful version of e nesbits five children and it previously filmed by the bbc in heman and transformers which were cartoon favourites in the s will soon receive their own costly makeovers with screen versions of the ateam the dukes of hazzard and even blakes seven on the cards nostalgia is clearly big business but some critics complain that these expensive takes on iconic series of yesteryear do not match up to our fond memories of the originals the new version of the magic roundabout which will be released as sprung in the us replaces the stopmotion models of the s tv show with polished computergenerated animation in a similar fashion the thunderbirds used human actors and special effects in place of the originals puppets and models the films are squarely pitched at younger audiences pop stars robbie williams and kylie minogue provide voices in the magic roundabout while the nowdefunct boy band busted performed the thunderbirds theme song but while some reviewers have been won over there has nonetheless been a significant backlash this cganimated adventure airbrushes the sly charm and trippy otherworldliness which made the s stopmotion roundabout a cult hit writes stella papamichael on the bbc movies site and the recent puppet comedy team america world police was in part provoked by its directors outrage that gerry andersons thunderbirds was remade without its signature mannequins dan jolin reviews editor of empire magazine says classic childrens tv shows have a builtin audience that make them ideal for reinvention i can understand why people are taking these intellectual properties and repackaging them for the kids of today but i think its backfiring whats next the clangers on some distant planet with some giant cgi soup dragons chasing after them despite thunderbirds disappointing global boxoffice performance the film cost m m but only recouped m m the nostalgia craze shows no signs of abating it can therefore be only a matter of time before some other tv favourites receive the hollywood treatment after the success of garfield the movie britains shabby tabby surely deserves his own film vehicle with only episodes made of the series there is plenty of room to explore the lives of the pink cat professor yaffle and the mice of the marvellous mechanical mouse organ furry recyclers have already had one bigscreen outing s wombling free but with environmental issues still occupying our thoughts it is high time they made a comeback advances in special effects technology could do wonders for the bbcs supernatural comedy and the success of pirates of the caribbean must surely herald a comeback for tvs most popular cartoon buccaneer it might also remind viewers the lewd character names often associated with the show never actually existed the magic roundabout is out in the uk on february how about bringing catweazle to the big screen he could give gandalf a run for his money thundercats i loved it should be fun to see on the big screen if some effort is put in it will bring my youth back get your hands off the clangers is nothing sacred make a movie version of the banana splits what about keanu reeves and richard gere in a remake of the wooden tops or perhaps robbie williams could get his much mooted acting career off the ground by taking on the role of andy pandy you forgot to mention the grearest of them all danger mouse but then again it couldnt be better than the original series could it its always nice to see these old toons rereleased but after the abysmal thunderbirds movie and the song i think ive been completely put off just leave these classics alone as good memories i think remakes are a good idea as the world moves on people tend to look more and more into the past to things that make them feel safe i believe this is the whole reason retro has become so popular as long as a remake does justice to the original then all it can do is create a wider audience and possibly entice a new generation of persons to enjoy and revive and old series personally id like to see cartoons such as transformers thundercats and mask get full hollywood remakes leave them alone why ruin something that we all have very fond memories of in the first place the thunderbirds film was apalling not a patch on the puppet series i grew up with and the magic roundabout will never be the same without the voice of eric thompson love to see transformers with real actors and cgi and make it at least a rating part of the reason for the success of such classics as the magic roundabout was that the characters were not the sweet and cuddly creatures that you would expect they were moody sarcastic and rather human just looking at the pictures of the animations for the new film show that these characteristics have not been preserved dougal never smiled like that films of this sort have an unfortunate habit of disneyfying everthing and they just lose the real magic that made the show special in the first place i have fond memories of bod not least of which because i look like him and would like to see someone attempt to make it into a film its got all the right material for an american blockbuster no plot and no story bod would likely be played by tom cruise and would undoubtedly have a girlfriend or two its all very well and good remaking these classic tv shows and films with all the latest technology for a new audience but for me a lot of the original charm is lost when they do this and seems more like a money making exercise to cash in on the original success of the programme than reinventing or improving it it maybe that to an audience who have never seen the originals they can watch them without prejudice but to people who have grown up with all these shows such as thunderbirds and magic roundabout which are part of our childhood they are never going to live up to expectation it does pose the question though that with all the long line of remakes being made are filmmakers running out of original ideas all i can say is bring back danger mouse probably the greatest kids show ever i recently rewatched some episodes and realised that there was a level of humour shown in danger mouse that was completely lost on me when i was a child there was a new captain pugwash cartoon made a couple of years back again like so many of these nostalgia programmes the animation this time computer created flatcell like animation failed to match the originals cut out paper technique for inventiveness and was woefully inadequate we live in a sampling world the music industry has been pludering past decades for inspiration clipping sounds from years ago is much cheaper and easier that doing something new seems that the film and tv is doing the same now its just cheaper to take ideas from the past and rework them rather than being daring and trying something new it got to be mrbenn the story line about a man who changes in a fancy dress shop steps into a door way and appears in another time and place would be amazing if they got a decent producer and writer the story line could be great and who to play the lead role well if it was a comedy then it would have to be someone like steve martin if its going to be an adventure then johnny depp playing a role similar to the pirates of the caribbean character muffin the mule perhaps after all grannies and grandpas go to the cinema as well you know why cant the british film industry try making gerry andersons ufo or captain scarlet or saphire and steel or the tomorrow people in todays media it seems the past is the future tv shows such as battlestar galactica have new remakes djs are sampling or reworking s and s music even computer games from years ago are getting modern reworkings personally i think it shows that no one has any originality any more why not just leave our mistyeyed nostalgia alone mary mungo and midge but of course for most of the episodes the lift would be out of order and they would have to use the stairs plus would mary be more of a vicky pollard character as she lives in a high rise council block yeah but no but i wasnt even there id like to see mr benn with brad pitt in the title role sean connery could play the mysterious costume shop owner it demonstrates a profound lack of imagination in todays filmmakers that they continually try to remake and remodel the past in an effort to cash in on nostalgia there are plany of modern childrens book that would make excellent films or tv programmes why not use them instead of rehashing the past mr benn with rowan atkinson as the lead would have loved to see dungeons dragons made but unfortunately the film that it was made into didnt come up to scratch the only one that isnt to be remade as yet is thundercats which id like to see im an expat living in norway and i recently went through a period of buying the dvds of many of my favourite childrens programs for my daughters my dearest wish however is to see a feature length version of noggin the nog appear on the big screen very scandinavian rainbow i believe that childrens classics should be left well alone and i will not be surprised if the magic roundabout does not do well at the box office especially since it will be going up against the spongebob squarepants movie popular among children because its original witty and modern the magic roundabout will never appeal to the children of today as it did all those many years ago how about classics like chorlton and the wheelies rentaghost terrahawks bodoh the list could go on and on if a transformers movie is indeed on the cards then ill be the first one on amazon buying a copy eagerly waiting at the front door with a frothy mouth and a nervous twitch repackage my childhood and sell it to me at an extortionate price i dont care till then ill have to make do with the citreon c advert id luv to see willow the wisp on the big screen but sadly without the late kenneth williams doing the voices it wouldnt be the same and who remembers trap door voiced by the late willie rushden superb childrens programme could morph hold his own in a big screen movie or even jamie and the magic torchhmmmmm i could go on and on danger mouse at im showing my age noggin the nog was one of the best childrens programs the problem with bringing it to the big screen is that noone could approach oliver postgates wonderful voices so in general leave well alone the originals are good because they are of their time and the methods used are an integral part of the story just imagine what could be achieved by using cgi in a remake of fingerbobs the already disturbing hand antics of the bearded hippy yoffi could take on a whole new level with a more lifelike fingermouse bob the builder postman pat and fireman sam together in an epic adventure of fire post and bricks in the ultimate struggle to save the women they love from the evil clowns krusty and gobo will they triumph or will they fail miserably find out this fall one puppet show that i personally would love to see made into a live action movie is joe it would be worth the price of admission alone to see the large screen version of joes car of course gerry andersons supermarionation is a rich seam of material worthy of bigscreen bigbudget action it was only that thunderbirds the movie was targetted as a childrent movie that really let it down after all the children that remember those shows with such affection are now the parents of children themselves its only because the people who were children when these programmes were first shown have grown up and are plundering their childhoods isnt it id hate to see bagpuss with perfect animation i love that done in a shed clunkiness and you couldnt recreate the magic perhaps if the remakes were done in a look around you mockauthentic style i might be interested chorton and the wheelies or jamie and his magic torch that would be mega this regurgitation of old films and tv shows makes me angry it is corporate laziness resting on the safety of other peoples ideas because it guarantees to bring in the the same can be said of modern day pop bands who release other peoples material will young etc the sad fact is nostalgia sells big bucks in the shortterm the fact that they will be forgotten in months time is irrelevant eg starsky hutch hence the market is saturated with this mindless drivel but it can only be stopped if people stop buying it i pray they never do a remake of chorlton and the wheelies im only and dont remember the series from when it was on tv but have the set on dvd and its a classic the fact its so great comes from the fact that there were very few special effects involved and compared to todays stuff it looks amateurish thats the appeal though its so innocent like chorlton himself and it would be a real shame if they did remake it stars shine on bafta red carpet hollywood stars brought a touch of glamour to london on saturday for the biggest night in the british film calendar cate blanchett leonardo dicaprio and richard gere

years according to box office figures in the us the five nominated for best film have been seen by fewer people than movies in previous years while the awards are not based on box office popularity there is concern for the ratings of the televised ceremony we dont have a titanic or a lord of the rings out there i think its fair to say it does concern us a bit said academy executive director bruce davis about million people in the us have seen this years nominees compared with between million and million in recent years the last time combined attendance was so low was in when amadeus beat the killing fields a passage to india places in the heart and a soldiers story to best picture when million saw the five films last years ceremony attracted the highest audience in four years as viewers tuned in to see lord of the ring return of the king sweep the board and the show reaped its biggest audience in when titanic took home oscars the film had taken m m worldwide before the ceremony and eventually took bn m eyeballs starring at the movie screen translates to eyeballs staring at the tv screen said paul dergarabedian of box office tracker exhibitor relations people like to have a vested interest in what theyre watching when titanic does bn in worldwide box office youve got a lot of people with a vested interest past years have also seen blockbusters such as saving private ryan forrest gump and ghost compete for oscars the biggest box office hitter among this years nominees is the aviator which has taken m m in the us although takings in the uk have reached only m so far lowbudget move sideways and finding neverland have so far grossed about m m each the years biggest blockbusters do actually feature in the oscar nominees but in the animation category shrek and the incredibles took m m while the incredibles took m m mel gibsons the passion of the christ which took m m in the us was largely ignored by academy voters but many in the film industry do not equate award and box office success i have never equated the academy awards with how much money a movie takes in said nikki rocco head of distribution at universal which released nominee ray thats the peoples choice awards this is not about the public this is about the industry bestowing awards on what they think are the best films of the year hitch holds on to us box office will smiths first

investigation the oscarwinning pulp fiction director has also written an original story for the season finale episode csis coproducer carol mendelsohn said the episode would have more bugs and blood than usual it is not tarantinos first venture into tv in he directed an episode of the medical drama er and has also appeared in alias ms mendelsohn said the production team had been trying for a while to get tarantino to direct an episode of csi and added that he was a fan of the forensic drama she said he finally agreed a few weeks ago while csi was doing some location shooting in las vegas and the shows stars persuaded him he knows everything there is to know about csi and he is into the whole mythology of csi mendelsohn said quentin came in a couple of weeks ago we had a story meeting with the writers he had a great idea and it was so much fun to have him in the room we are positively giddy filming is due to start in early april and the tarantinodirected episode will be broadcast in the us on may us afflicted with awards fatigue the film world and media may be wild about the oscars but cinemagoers and the tvviewing public are sick of watching award ceremonies according to some la film critics bob strauss from the la daily news thinks there are just too many televised gatherings of stars showering praise on each other he came up with a colourful but unprintable description for these glitzy events which roughly translates a celebrity lovein this echoed the views of oscars host and comedian chris rock who whipped up a media storm for saying he rarely watched them calling award shows idiotic as chris rock accurately said theyre about celebrity and fashion mr strauss said the recent grammy music awards proved to be a ratings loser and it seems oscars organisers are determined not to go the same way recently announced changes to the ceremony include lining up all five nominees on stage before announcing the winner unsurprisingly this prompted press speculation that the changes were aimed at boosting flagging advertising revenue but entertainment weeklys dave karger maintained the oscars only generated excitement outside the industry when a blockbuster such as titanic or lord of the rings was nominated the near constant flow of us film awards representing directors actors and producers guilds also means few surprises are left by the time the oscar ceremony is upon us he said a quick scan of the los angeles times and los angeles daily news bears this out speculation about who will win seems to have ground to a halt on thursday the times simply printed a picture of the plastic tents going up outside the kodak theatre to protect the red carpet from rain variety and the hollywood reporter have also kept their focus firmly on industryrelated news while in the uk bets have closed on the best actor category with ray star jamie foxx a dead cert to win screen internationals us editor mike goodridge thinks s films have simply not grabbed the publics imagination filmmakers havent produced films that people adore this year he said they adored saving private ryan for example people loved it and it made a ton of money s films could be a reaction to there was a realisation in america that things might not be so rosy after all audiences dont necessarily want to see darker films such as million dollar baby aviator and finding neverland which end with casualty as to whether rock could pep up the awards the critics were not hopeful mr strauss doubted whether rock would make an impact but added im all for lower ratings though there are far more important things going on than the oscars mr karger said the comic might boost younger viewers but mike goodridge thought rocks humour could prompt americas conservative states to switch off so despite all this did the critics have any views on who would win clint eastwoods million dollar baby affected people emotionally which is why it will beat aviator which was about technical artistry not feelings mr karger said eastwood has it in the bag added mr strauss oscar voters often vote with their hearts not their heads and mr goodridge said best film and director were between martin scorseses aviator and million dollar baby mr karger whose favourite film of the year was mike leighs abortion drama vera drake stayed upbeat about the awards despite his other comments i hope this is the year for small films to triumph he said after all its still one of the biggest tv events of the year critics back aviator for oscars martin scorseses the aviator will win best film at the oscars according to the uks leading movie critics but several of those surveyed by the bbc news website think the veteran filmmaker will lose the best director prize to clint eastwood most of the critics tipped jamie foxx and hilary swank to scoop best actor and actress for ray and million dollar baby respectively the jury comprised experts and critics from the top uk film publications the panel also revealed which nominees they would personally prefer to win all expect the aviator to win best film but many think it will be a close race between scorseses howard hughes biopic and eastwoods boxing drama million dollar baby the other films nominated are wine comedy sideways factual drama finding neverland and ray charles biopic ray im pretty sure this is the year of the aviator though my own choice would be sideways said the observers philip french sideways should win but it doesnt have a hope said jamie graham of total film a position shared by film presenter jonathan ross the form going in to the oscars points to the aviator but i liked million dollar baby more said tim dams news editor of trade weekly screen international five of the eight critics tipped scorsese to win best director with mr dams heats charles gant and empires angie errigo plumping for eastwood sideways alexander payne rays taylor hackford and british director mike leigh nominated for period drama vera drake are considered outsiders in this category up until recently i could have sworn scorsese would get it just for being scorsese ms errigo told the bbc news website but im beginning to think eastwood will get it id be very happy for mike leigh to win but i dont think he has any chance said charles gant film editor of heat foxxs portrayal of ray charles has already seen him win prizes at the golden globes baftas and screen actors guild awards mr dams said this made him outandout favourite to be named best actor on oscar night everyone would be incredibly surprised if he didnt win he said if youre a betting man hes as close as you get to a certainty if paul giamatti was nominated for sideways it would be a different game says total films jamie graham but foxx will and should win with vera drake star imelda staunton nominated for best actress alongside kate winslet britain has a good chance of victory on paper jonathan ross for one will be very happy if winslet wins for eternal sunshine of the spotless mind but while wendy ide of the times still thinks staunton has a chance heats charles gant believes her bafta win will cut little ice with academy voters id like staunton to win but her chances are not that great said mr gant who predicted a second oscar for hilary swank i think swank will win said mr french imelda has got as far as shes going to get playing that role staunton is also the personal choice of steven gaydos executive editor of industry magazine variety but while he tipped swank to win he predicted it would be a close contest everything has the ability to flip by one vote and go the other way he told the bbc news website theres not a sense that its obvious how its going to go meanwhile thousands of people have voted in a bbc radio five live poll to find the best film never to have won a best picture oscar the audience voted overwhelmingly for the shawshank redemption the frank darabont tale of hope and humanity which received of the

honoured weve all been overwhelmed by the response and cant get it in perspective yet im still reeling and she wont commit to an opinion of hollywood yet im just in the middle of it living moment to moment day to day but despite her reservations about the academy awards and the media frenzy that surrounds it she accepts that it has opened doors for her people will definitely listen to what i want to do now and the phone didnt stop ringing for a week after i got nominated as for the future arnold firmly believes that you often get a stronger vision of the world with short films youre left more
