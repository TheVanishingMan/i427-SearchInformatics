labour plans maternity pay rise maternity pay for new mothers is to rise by as part of new proposals announced by the trade and industry secretary patricia hewitt it would mean paid leave would be increased to nine months by ms hewitt told gmtvs sunday programme other plans include letting maternity pay be given to fathers and extending rights to parents of older children the tories dismissed the maternity pay plan as desperate while the liberal democrats said it was misdirected ms hewitt said we have already doubled the length of maternity pay it was weeks when we were elected we have already taken it up to weeks we are going to extend the pay to nine months by and the aim is to get it right up to the full months by the end of the next parliament she said new mothers were already entitled to months leave but that many women could not take it as only six of those months were paid we have made a firm commitment we will definitely extend the maternity pay from the six months where it now is to nine months thats the extra she said ministers would consult on other proposals that could see fathers being allowed to take some of their partners maternity pay or leave period or extending the rights of flexible working to carers or parents of older children the shadow secretary of state for the family theresa may said these plans were announced by gordon brown in his prebudget review in december and tony blair is now recycling it in his desperate bid to win back women voters she said the conservatives would announce their proposals closer to the general election liberal democrat spokeswoman for women sandra gidley said while mothers would welcome any extra maternity pay the liberal democrats feel this money is being misdirected she said her party would boost maternity pay in the first six months to allow more women to stay at home in that time ms hewitt also stressed the plans would be paid for by taxpayers not employers but david frost director general of the british chambers of commerce warned that many small firms could be crippled by the move while the majority of any salary costs may be covered by the governments statutory pay recruitment costs advertising costs retraining costs and the strain on the company will not be he said further details of the governments plans will be outlined on monday new mothers are currently entitled to of average earnings for the first six weeks after giving birth followed by a week until the baby is six months old hewitt decries career sexism plans to extend paid maternity leave beyond six months should be prominent in labours election manifesto the trade and industry secretary has said patricia hewitt said the cost of the proposals was being evaluated but it was an increasingly high priority and a shared goal across government ms hewitt was speaking at a gender and productivity seminar organised by the equal opportunities commission eoc mothers can currently take up to six months paid leave and six unpaid ms hewitt told the seminar clearly one of the things we need to do in the future is to extend the period of payment for maternity leave beyond the first six months into the second six months we are looking at how quickly we can do that because obviously there are cost implications because the taxpayer reimburses the employers for the cost of that ms hewitt also announced a new drive to help women who want to work in male dominated sectors saying sexism at work was still preventing women reaching their full potential plans include funding for universities to help female science and engineering graduates find jobs and taster courses for men and women in nontraditional jobs women in fulltime work earn less than men according to the equal opportunities commission eoc the minister told delegates that getting rid of career sexism was vital to closing the gender pay gap career sexism limits opportunities for women of all ages and prevents them from achieving their full potential it is simply wrong to assume someone cannot do a job on the grounds of their sex she said earlier she told bbc radio s today programme what we are talking about here is the fact that about six out of women work in jobs that are lowpaid and typically dominated by women so we have got very segregated employment unfortunately in some cases this reflects very oldfashioned and stereotypical ideas about the appropriate jobs for women or indeed for men career sexism is about saying that engineering for instance where only of employees are women is really a maledominated industry construction is even worse but it is also about saying childcare jobs are really there for women and not suitable for men career sexism goes both ways she added that while progress had been made there was still a gap in pay figures the average woman working fulltime is being paid about p for every pound a man is earning for women working parttime it is p the department for trade and industry will also provide funding to help a new pay experts panel run by the tuc it has been set up to advise hundreds of companies on equal wage policies research conducted by the eoc last year revealed that many britons believe the pay gap between men and women is the result of natural differences between the sexes women hold less than of the top positions in ftse companies the police the judiciary and trade unions according to their figures and retired women have just over half the income of their male counterparts on average labour chooses manchester the labour party will hold its autumn conference in manchester and not blackpool it has been confirmed the much trailed decision was ratified by labours ruling national executive committee in a break with the traditional choice of a seaside venue it will be the first time since that the party has chosen manchester to host the annual event blackpool will get the much smaller february spring conference instead in what will be seen as a placatory move for years the main political parties have rotated between blackpool bournemouth and brighton and the news the much larger annual conference is not to gather in blackpool will be seen as a blow in the coastal resort in the party said it would not return to blackpool but did so in the following year bournemouth hosted the event before the party signed a two year deal for brighton to host the autumn conference colin asplin blackpool hotel association said we have tried very hard to make sure they come back to blackpool obviously we have failed in that i just hope manchester can handle the crowds it amazes me that the labour party which is a working class party doesnt want to come to the main working class resort in the country the exact cost to blackpool in terms of lost revenue for hotel accommodation is not yet known but it is thought that block bookings will be taken at the major manchester hotels after the official announcement brown ally rejects budget spree chancellor gordon browns closest ally has denied suggestions there will be a budget giveaway on march ed balls exchief economic adviser to the treasury said there would be no spending spree before polling day but mr balls a prospective labour mp said he was confident the chancellor would meet his fiscal rules he was speaking as sir digby jones cbi director general warned mr brown not to be tempted to use any extra cash on preelection bribes mr balls who stepped down from his treasury post to stand as a labour candidate in the election had suggested that mr brown would meet his golden economic rule with a margin to spare he said he hoped more would be done to build on current tax credit rules he also stressed rise in interest rates ahead of an expected may election would not affect the labour partys chances of winning expectations of a rate rise have gathered pace after figures showed house prices are still rising consumer borrowing rose at a nearrecord pace in january if the mpc the bank of englands monetary policy committee were to judge that a rate rise was justified before the election because of the strength of the economy and im not predicting that they will i do not believe that this will be a big election issue in britain for labour he told a parliamentary lunch this is a big change in our political culture during an interview with bbc radio s today programme mr balls said he was sure mr browns budget would not put at risk the stability of the economy i dont think well see a preelection spending spree we certainly did not see that before he said his assurances came after sir digby jones said stability was all important and any extra cash should be spent on improving workers skills his message to the chancellor was please dont give it away in any form of electioneering sir digby added i dont think he will i have to say he has been a prudent chancellor right the way through stability is the key word british business needs boring stability more than anything we would say to him dont increase your public spending dont give it away but if you are going to anywhere just add something to the competitiveness of britain put it into skilling our people that would be a good way to spend any excess mr balls refused to say whether mr brown would remain as chancellor after the election amid speculation he will be offered the job of foreign secretary i think that gordon brown wants to be part of the successful labour government which delivers in the third term for the priorities of the people and sees off a conservative party that will take britain backwards mr balls told today prime minister tony blair has yet to name the date of the election but most pundits are betting on may errors doomed first dome sale the initial attempt to sell the millennium dome failed due to a catalogue of errors a report by the governments finance watchdog says the report said too many parties were involved in decisionmaking when the attraction first went on sale after the millennium exhibition ended the national audit office said the dome cost taxpayers m to maintain and sell in the four years after it closed finally a deal to turn it into a sport and entertainment venue was struck more than m could now be returned to the public sector in the wake of the deal to regenerate the site in greenwich london the nao report said that this sale went through because it avoided many of the problems of the previous attempt to sell the dome deputy prime minister john prescott said a good deal had been secured delivery of the many benefits secured through this deal will continue the substantial progress already made at the millennium village and elsewhere on the peninsula he said but edward leigh who is chairman of the commons public accounts committee warned the government would have to work hard to ensure taxpayers would get full benefit from the dome deal he said this report also shows that the first attempt to sell the dome proved a complete fiasco every arm of government seems to have had a finger in the pie the process was confused and muddled he added four years after the millennium exhibition closed the government finally has a deal to find a use for what has been a white elephant since it closed in a deal that incredible as it may seem should bring in some money and provide a benefit for the local area and the country as whole however it was more a question of luck that a strong bid turned up after thefirst abortive attempt nao head sir john bourn said in difficult circumstances following the failure of the first competition english partnerships and the office of the deputy prime minister have worked hard to get a deal fox attacks blairs tory lies tony blair lied when he took the uk to war so has no qualms about lying in the election campaign say the tories tory cochairman liam fox was speaking after mr blair told labour members the tories offered a hard right agenda dr fox told bbc radio if you are willing to lie about the reasons for going to war i guess you are going to lie about anything at all he would not discuss reports the party repaid to lord ashcroft after he predicted an election defeat the prime minister ratcheted up labours preelection campaigning at the weekend with a helicopter tour of the country and his speech at the partys spring conference he insisted he did not know the poll date but it is widely expected to be may in what was seen as a highly personal speech in gateshead on sunday mr blair said i have the same passion and hunger as when i first walked through the door of downing street he described his relationship with the public as starting euphoric then struggling to live up to the expectations and reaching the point of raised voices and throwing crockery he warned his supporters against complacency saying its a fight for the future of our country its a fight that for britain and the people of britain we have to win mr blair said that whether the public chose michael howard or mr kennedy it would result in a tory government not a labour government and a country that goes back and does not move forward dr fox accused mr blair and other cabinet ministers of telling lies about their opponents policies and then attacking the lies what we learned at the weekend is what labour tactics are going to be and its going to be fear and smear he told bbc news the tory cochairman attacked labours six new pledges as vacuous and said mr blair was very worried voters would take revenge for his failure to deliver dr fox refused to discuss weekend newspaper reports that the party had repaid to former tory treasurer lord ashcroft after he said the party could not win the election we repay loans when they are due but do not comment to individual financial matters he said insisting he enjoyed a warm and constructive relationship to lord ashcroft meanwhile lib dem leader charles kennedy is expected to attack mr blairs words as he begins a nationwide tour on monday mr kennedy is accelerating lib dem election preparations this week as he visits manchester liverpool leicester somerset basingstoke shrewsbury dorset and torbay he said this is threeparty politics in the northern cities the contest is between labour and the liberal democrats in southern and rural seats especially in the south west the principal contenders are the liberal democrats and the conservatives who are out of the running in scotland and wales the lib dems accuse mr blair of making a touchyfeely speech to labour delegates which will not help him regain public trust women mps reveal sexist taunts women mps endure shocking levels of sexist abuse at the hands of their male counterparts a new study shows male mps pretended to juggle imaginary breasts and jeered melons as women made commons speeches researchers from birkbeck college were told labours yvette cooper said she found it hard to persuade commons officials she was a minister and not a secretary some mps gave their answers in hours of taped interviews for the study whose secretary are you minister the research team under professor joni lovenduski had set out to look at the achievements and experiences of women at westminster but what emerged was complaints from mps of all parties of sexist barracking in the chamber sexist insults and patronising assumptions about their abilities barbara follet one of the socalled blair babes elected in told researchers i remember some conservatives whenever a labour woman got up to speak they would take their breasts imaginary breasts in their hands and wiggle them and say melons as we spoke former liberal democrat mp jackie ballard recalled a stream of remarks from a leading mp on topics such as womens legs or their sexual persuasion and extory education secretary gillian shepherd remembered how one of her male colleagues called all women betty when i said look you know my name isnt betty he said ah but youre all the same so i call you all betty harriet harman told researchers of the sheer hostility prompted by her advancement to the cabinet well youve only succeeded because youre a woman another current member of the cabinet says she was told oh youve had a very fast rise who have you been sleeping with even after the great influx of women mps at the general election and greater numbers of women in the cabinet female mps often say they feel stuck on the edge of a male world liberal democrat sarah teather the most recent female mp to be elected told researchers lots of people say its like an old boys club ive always said to me it feels more like a teenage public school you know a public school full of teenagers prof joni lovenduski who conducted the study with the help of margaret moran mp and a team of journalists said she was shocked at the findings we expected a bit of this but nothing like this extent we expected to find a couple of shocking episodes but she said there was a difference between the experiences of women before the intake and afterwards this was mainly because there were more women present in parliament who were not prepared to put up with the sexist attitudes they came across prof lovenduski said but she added some women including the women who came in received extraordinary treatment and i am not convinced that if the number of women changed back to what it was before that things would not change back what i think is shocking to the general public is that these things go on in the house of commons the interviews are to be placed in the british library as a historical record crucial decision on supercasinos a decision on whether to allow westminster to legislate on supercasinos is set to be made by the scottish parliament the government has plans for up to eight las vegas style resorts in the uk one of which is likely to be in glasgow scottish ministers insist they will still have the final say on whether a supercasino will be built in scotland but opposition parties say that will not happen in practice the vote is due to be taken on wednesday and is expected to be close the scottish executive believes that the legislation should be handled by westminster the new law will control internet gambling for the first time and is aimed at preventing children from becoming involved a supercasino in glasgow could be located at ibrox or the scottish exhibition and conference centre the new gambling bill going through westminster will allow casino complexes to open to the public have live entertainment and large numbers of fruit machines with unlimited prizes but the scottish national party and the tories say the issue of supercasinos should be decided in scotland and believe the executive is shirking its responsibility pm apology over jailings tony blair has apologised to two families who suffered one of the uks biggest miscarriages of justice the prime minister was commenting on the wrongful jailing of people for ira bomb attacks on pubs in guildford and woolwich in mr blair said i am very sorry that they were subject to such an ordeal and injustice he made the apology to members of the conlon and maguire families in his private room at westminster in a statement recorded for television mr blair said the families deserved to be completely and publicly exonerated the families had hoped the apology would be made during prime ministers questions in the house of commons however one of the socalled guildford four gerry conlon who was wrongly convicted of planting the bombs said the families were delighted with the apology he said mr blair had spoken with such sincerity adding he went beyond what we thought he would he took time to listen to everyone you could see he was moved by what people were saying tony blair has healed rifts he is helping to heal wounds its a day i never thought would come the move followed a huge campaign in ireland for a public apology after eleven people were wrongly convicted of making and planting the ira bombs which killed seven people mr blairs official spokesman said noone present at the meeting would ever forget the strength of feeling of relief that the prime ministers statement brought to them most of those convicted were either members or friends of the two families all were arrested because of a family connection to gerry conlon mr conlons father giuseppe was arrested when travelling to london from belfast to help his son he died while serving his sentence also arrested were anne maguire and members of her family mrs maguire was the relative with whom giuseppe planned to stay in london as well as two family friends she said it was a wonderful feeling to have had the apology and that a weight had been lifted off her shoulders the people who were still doubting us should now believe that we were totally innocent she said they were all jailed for handling explosives based on scientific evidence which was later entirely discredited in october the court of appeal quashed the sentences of the guildford four and in june it overturned the sentences on the maguire seven mr conlons case was highlighted in the oscarnominated film in the name of the father starring daniel daylewis blair rejects tory terror offer tony blair has rejected a conservative compromise offer that could have eased the passage of antiterror legislation the tories wanted a sunset clause inserted in the antiterrorism bill that would have forced ministers to revisit it in november mr blair said the bill which brings in house arrest for terror suspects had time limiting safeguards already the tories say they will vote against it unless changes they want are agreed the lib dems also oppose the plans the government has already given way over the role of judges in house arrest cases mr blairs refusal to accept the tories sunset clause proposals means that the government faces concerted opposition from all sides in the lords peers begin three days of detailed deliberation on the bill on thursday the bill proposes control orders which as well as placing terrorism suspects under house arrest could mean curfews tagging or bans on telephone and internet use these would replace current powers to detain foreign terror suspects without trial which the law lords have ruled against as a breach of human rights the tories want judicial oversight of all control orders not just house arrest shadow home secretary david davis told bbc radio fours the world at one his primary concern was potential miscarriages of justice he said if someone was wrongly given a control order it would act as a recruiting sergeant for terrorists he went on to say if we dont get the amendments we regard as essential including the sunset clause we will vote against the bill in the commons mr howard said it would be far better if the whole of the legislation was subject to a sunset clause so parliament could consider it all in a proper way instead of it being ramrodded through mr blair said the house arrest powers were already going to be subject to a sunset clause because it was annually renewable the second less stringent type of control orders would be subject to a court appeal within days and there would be a threemonthly report on their use by an eminent and independent person i believe the new powers are a proper balance between the civil liberties of the subject and the necessary national security of this country that i will not put at risk said mr blair the lib dems plan to oppose the bill in the lords on thursday lib dem home affairs spokesman mark oaten said theres a lot of talking left i would be uneasy about supporting a very bad bill even if it was just for eight months a spokeswoman for human rights watch said it was a basic principle that people should only be punished after a fair trial she added having a judge impose those punishments without a trial does not sanitise them either talks held on gibraltars future two days of talks on the future of gibraltar begin at jack straws country residence later on wednesday officials at the twoday summit at the foreign secretarys official kent house chevening will plan a new forum on the rocks future in october mr straw and his spanish counterpart miguel moratinos agreed to establish a body that would give gibraltarians a voice in their future most gibraltarians said in a referendum they wanted to remain british gibraltars chief minister peter caruana will represent the british citizens living on the rock while britains europe director dominick chilcott will represent the uk madrid is being represented by spains director general for europe jose maria pons the initiative follows spains socialist governments decision to put its longstanding sovereignty ambitions on hold gibraltarians rejected plans for the rocks sovereignty to be shared between britain and spain in a referendum organised by gibraltar government crisis ahead in social sciences a national body designed to tackle skills shortages in key subjects should be set up a committee of mps has said there was an absolute crisis in the recruitment of statisticians and other social science experts the commons science and technology committee added major problems are expected over the next years as the social science workforce continues to age it said the committee was reporting on the work strategy and spending plans of the economic social research council the council aims to promote and support strategic research for social science postgraduates and provide social scientists to meet the needs of the country it also liaises with the government and industry over their social science needs in its report on the councils work the committee said we are deeply concerned by the skills shortages afflicting in particular the qualitative branches of social sciences this mirrored previous concerns the committee had expressed on shortages in the fields of maths and chemistry it said it is hard to see how significant progress towards rectifying these shortages can be made through the deployment of economic and social research councils limited resources if the government is serious about addressing skills shortages in key subjects it needs to find a more effective mechanism to achieve this a national strategic capabilities fund to address shortages in key areas should be set up in response the committee added tsunami debt deal to be announced chancellor gordon brown has said he hopes to announce a deal to suspend debt interest repayments by tsunamihit nations later on friday the agreement by the g group of wealthy nations would save affected countries bn pounds a year he said the deal is thought to have been hammered out on thursday night after japan one of the biggest creditor nations finally signed up to it mr brown first proposed the idea earlier this week g ministers are also believed to have agreed to instruct the world bank and the international monetary fund to complete a country by country analysis of the reconstruction problems faced by all states hit by the disaster mr brown has been locked in talks with finance ministers of the g which britain now chairs germany also proposed a freeze and canada has begun its own moratorium the expected deal comes as foreign secretary jack straw said the number of britons dead or missing in the disaster have reached drink remark acts as diversion the first ministers statement that it was okay to get drunk once in a while has diverted attention from the real issues it has been claimed jack law chief executive of alcohol focus scotland said jack mcconnells comment was illadvised the media attention had helped to move the focus from scotlands binge drinking problems mr law said scotsman journalist hamish macdonell said he believed the bigger picture had been obscured by the remark mr mcconnell was speaking on monday to more than secondary pupils from schools in the highlands about the problems of binge drinking and drink promotions the onesentence comment was immediately criticised by the scottish national party which accused him of encouraging young people to get drunk but the scottish executive has insisted mr mcconnell was speaking about adults and his comments were a recognition that people will get drunk mr macdonell political editor of the scotsman said i think we have to say right at the outset that this was a very stupid and illadvised remark by the first minister if you come out with something like this saying that by all means get drunk then you will be pilloried for it however he added that perhaps mr mcconnell could feel rightly aggrieved about the coverage mr macdonell said i think the problem here is that he did say a lot more things about binge drinking and under age drinking but that whole side of things has been lost in the furore over one sentence i understand why but i think there is a much bigger message here that has been obscured mr law from voluntary body alcohol focus scotland believed damage had been done to scotlands fight against binge drinking he said he accepted that young people drank and they did have problems with drink mr law added i think the remark was illadvised but these remarks are blown out of all proportion and they so easily misrepresent what we are trying to do in scotland we dont want to preach to young people but we need to acknowledge that they do drink problematically this diverts us from the real issues which are about promoting responsibility and reducing harm and indeed tackling our drinking culture which is a culture about binge drinking and drunkenness he said it was vital that young people were properly informed about the risks incurred to themselves and others when they got drunk mr macdonell said that the first minister should know by now that if he said things which were off the mark they were bound to come back and bite him he added here mr mcconnell was talking in the highlands to teenagers and every word he said was put out on a webcast by the scottish executive and then looked at by other politicians and reporters i think in this instance he has done a lot of really good things and he will be regretting this remark the scottish national partys holyrood leader nicola sturgeon wrote to mr mcconnell on tuesday accusing him of an error of judgement and calling for him to apologise for his illjudged comment and withdraw it immediately in a furious response the first minister said his comments had been distorted and taken out of context he told ms sturgeon it is disappointing that you have contributed to this distortion by saying it is staggering that i should encourage young people to get drunk that is completely untrue perhaps it would have been wiser for you to find out what was actually said before you rushed to represent my position undermine the convener of education at highland council and insult the intelligence of the young people i spoke with all for the sake of a simple soundbite concerns at school diploma plan final appeals are being made for the government not to ditch the reform plan for englands secondary schools put forward by the tomlinson report the governments response to the plan for a fourtier diploma to replace all existing qualifications is expected next week some are worried it could be scuppered if as tony blair and ruth kelly have suggested gcses and alevels stay sir mike tomlinson himself was briefed only this week he is said to be feeling more comfortable about what the government is likely to say than if he had read only what was in newspapers in the earlier part of the week but the government was said to be still rewriting its response on friday it will be a tragedy if the government comes through with a halfhearted response said the chairman of the commons education select committee labour mp barry sheerman his main concern was the reports that there would be a diploma but only to replace existing vocational qualifications we must tackle headon the structural mess that is our secondary education system he wrote in the times educational supplement it is not the case that the academic stream in secondary is fine while the vocational route is desperately weak the qualifications and curriculum authority qca has also told the government not to compromise the qca said the potential stepchange in participation and attainment lay in the integrity of the whole diploma any partial implementation of the proposals would in our view compromise that integrity said its chairman sir anthony greener it is a sign of the qcas concern that its advice went to ministers last december but was publicised only recently but people understand that a white paper response is government policy and has to command wider ministerial support than if it were coming only from the department for education and skills they may be content if it does not close too many doors in writing whatever spin is put on it the chief inspector of schools david bell also said recently that gcses and alevels should go one of the reasons why im so strongly in favour of these terms disappearing over time is that its good for the symbols of change to be seen right across the system he said if we dont say this is a seachange in education we will miss a great opportunity universities and head teachers in both the independent and state sectors have also backed the tomlinson proposals which include having higher grades at advanced level to differentiate between the brightest students a note of concern has been expressed repeatedly by the employers organisation the cbi which complains of a lack of skills in an attempt to address this the tomlinson plan is for tests in functional maths and literacy decidedly not gcses it has been suggested the government will take steps of some sort to meet firms concerns on this score another dissenter is sir mike tomlinsons predecessor as chief schools inspector professor chris woodhead who has said there is no need for such a massive upheaval the conservative party has put forward plans to revert to a system of having only the brightest percentage of students each year getting the top alevel grade no matter how well the others have done nat insurance to rise say tories national insurance will be raised if labour wins the next election tory leader michael howard has claimed tony blair has said he does not want higher tax rates for top earners but on wednesday said other tax promises would be left to labours manifesto prime ministers questions also saw mr blair predict that new plans would probably cut net immigration he attacked tory plans to process asylum claims abroad but mr howard said labour had proposed the idea too the commons questions session again saw the leaders of the two biggest parties shape up for the forthcoming election campaign the tories have promised bn in tax cuts but have yet to say where they will fall mr howard pointed to the institute for fiscal studies predictions that labour will need to increase taxes to cover an bn gap in its spending plans he accused ministers of wasting money on unsuccessful attempts to curb bad behaviour and truancy in schools and on slow asylum processing it was no good mr blair claiming tax pledges were being left to the manifesto as he had given one to mps on tuesday about the top rate of income tax argued mr howard pointing to national insurance he added everyone knows tax will go up under labour isnt it now clear which tax it would be mr blair instead hailed labours achievement in using a strong economy to invest in public services when we have money not only going into extra teachers and nurses but equipment in schools and hospitals that money is not wasted he said on the tax questions he added we will make commitments on tax at the time of the manifesto home secretary charles clarke this week published plans for a new points system for economic migrants with only highskilled workers allowed into the uk from outside the european union mr blair said abuses would be weeded out and chain migration where families automatically get the right to settle with immigrant workers would end that would probably create a fall in the migrant numbers he said the prime minister ridiculed the tory plans for asylum quotas and for processing all asylum claims overseas he challenged the tories on which country would house their processing centres what he called a fantasy island mr howard read from a letter about the governments own plans at the european council of ministers for processing asylum seekers outside the eu but mr blair said all the other countries could not agree on the way forward nor could the un euniversity disgraceful waste a failed government scheme to offer uk university courses online has been branded a disgraceful waste by mps the euniversity was scrapped last year having attracted only students at a cost of m chief executive john beaumont was paid a bonus of despite a failure to bring in private sector backers the commons education select committee called this morally indefensible but the government said the euniversity project had improved understanding a department for education and skills spokeswoman said the venture had been ambitious and groundbreaking but takeup had not been sufficient to continue with the project she added uk euniversities was not the only organisation to have lost out on private sector investment in the collapse of the dotcom boom the select committee found that those responsible for founding the euniversity in had been caught up in the general atmosphere of enthusiasm surrounding the internet initial business plans forecast a quarter of a million students joining within a decade bringing in at least m in profit but virtually no market research was carried out and just m was spent on worldwide sales and marketing of courses some m went on developing the technology to make the euniversity work this was used by just students the rest preferring to work through existing university websites with no significant private investors and no direct accountability to a government minister the euniversity had had too much freedom to spend public money as it wished the report found committee chairman barry sheerman said uk euniversity was a terrible waste of public money the senior executives failed to interest any private investors and showed an extraordinary overconfidence in their ability to attract students to the scheme the report warns that the government should not be scared off investment in innovative but potentially risky schemes by the failure of the euniversity but should learn the lessons from this disaster brown visits slum on africa trip chancellor gordon brown has visited kenyas biggest shantytown as he opened a weeklong visit to africa mr browns trip is designed to highlight how the uk wants to make africas problems a priority of its chairmanship of the g this year he will see an hivaids orphanage in tanzania and a womens credit union in mozambique before chairing a meeting of the commission for africa in cape town at slums in narobi on wednesday he said education needs had to be tackled speaking outside the olympic primary school mr brown said it is simply not acceptable in the modern age for the rest of the world to stand by and have hundreds of millions of children not getting the chance at education he pointed to international plans to invest bn for education in africa over the next decade the school is on the edge of kibera where live often in huts made of mud scrap metal and cardboard mr browns aides say he wants to find out more about the kenyan governments education policies which included introducing free primary education in early the chancellor has already unveiled proposals for a g aid package which he has likened to the marshall plan used by the united states to rebuild europe after world war two the trip follows claims of infighting between mr brown and tony blair detailed in a new book conservative leader michael howard is expected to seize on those reports at prime ministers questions at gmt on wednesday blair sets date for africa report the commission for africas report will be released on march comic relief day tony blair has said julys g summit in gleneagles in perthshire chaired by the prime minister will use the report as the basis for talks on africa the announcement followed the final meeting of the commission which includes singer bob geldof in london as well as more aid fairer trade and less debt the commission is likely to demand action on corruption in africa mr blair told a news conference it will be a report thats brutally frank about the reality but i hope idealistic about what can be done if the will is there its an ambitious project we have set ourselves and you will have to judge on its outcome when we publish it mr blair has vowed to put africa at the top of his agenda during his time at the helm of the g he acknowledged he would have a a job of persuading to do on other nations to get the necessary commitment to debt relief bob geldof in characteristically blunt style promised that the commission would not just be a talking shop but would deliver radical new thinking to change direction for africa the former rock stars presence on the commission has been interpreted as a sign that it will be uncompromising in its demands the people involved include two african government leaders and a range of other african politicians as well as experts from some other developed countries butler launches attack on blair former civil service chief lord butler has criticised the way tony blairs government operates accusing it of being obsessed with headlines he also attacked the way the iraq war was sold to the public with important warnings on the strength of the intelligence left out tory leader michael howard said lord butler had given the most damaging testimony he could remember but downing street said mr blair should be judged by results not his style lord butler said mr blair bypassed the cabinet and relied instead on small informal groups of advisers to help him make decisions the prime ministers official spokesman said the cabinet was still used to achieve a consensus on important issues but he added you cannot in a modern government take every decision in cabinet its just not possible lord butler said the government had too much freedom to bring in bad bills and to do whatever it likes and it relied too much on the advice of political appointees the former cabinet secretary said in an interview with the spectator magazine i would be critical of the present government in that there is too much emphasis on selling there is too much central control and there is too little of what i would describe as reasoned deliberation which brings in all the arguments mr howard described lord butlers intervention as very important this is from someone who was an insider at the very heart of the blair government it is certainly the most damaging testimony i can ever remember from someone in such an eminent position lord butlers report earlier this year into iraq intelligence said the governments september weapons dossier did not make clear intelligence about claims that saddam hussein had stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons was very thin the reason for this is that it would have weakened ministers case for war lord butler said in his spectator interview which was conducted by the magazines editor conservative mp boris johnson he said when civil servants give material to ministers they say these are the conclusions weve drawn but weve got to tell you the evidence weve got is pretty thin similarly if you are giving something to the united nations and the country you should warn them asked why he thought the warnings were not there lord butler said one has got to remember what the purpose of the dossier was the purpose of the dossier was to persuade the british why the government thought iraq was a very serious threat when asked whether he thought the country was wellgoverned on the whole he replied well i think we are a country where we suffer very badly from parliament not having sufficient control over the executive and that is a very grave flaw we should be breaking away from the party whip the executive is much too free to bring in a huge number of extremely bad bills a huge amount of regulation and to do whatever it likes and whatever it likes is what will get the best headlines tomorrow all that is part of what is bad government in this country lord butlers assessment was backed by his predecessor as cabinet secretary lord armstrong lord armstrong told bbc twos newsnight i agree there doesnt appear to be the sort of informed collective political judgement brought to bear on decisionmaking that those affected by decisions are entitled to expect liberal democrat deputy leader menzies campbell said he thought lord butlers comments were well justified and mr blairs style of leadership was corrosive of the whole system of government but labour former minister jack cunningham accused lord butler of basing his comments on the first eight months of the incoming labour administration when he was cabinet secretary mr cunningham told bbc radio s today programme taken together robin butlers comments are partial inaccurate and cannot be taken as anything other than politically biased against the labour government lib dems demand new inquiry a judge should look into the david blunkett controversy as key questions remain unanswered the lib dems say sir alan budds inquiry linked the exhome secretary to the speeding up of a visa claim by his exlovers nanny but he could not say whether mr blunkett had treated the nanny as a special case or had used her as an example of immigration problems lib dem spokesman mark oaten said the number of officials who had forgotten what happened was worrying he told bbc news im extremely concerned that individuals appear to have forgotten what happened or more suspiciously are not prepared to say what happened that must be bad for government it must be bad for public confidence in the system mr oaten said people would be mystified why sir alans inquiry failed to uncover why processing of the visa application was speeded up he said there is a strong case for a judgeled judicial review of this because of course next time it happens it may not be about a nanny and their visa it may be about something even more important than that so we do need to understand what took place and who was involved the tories criticised the lib dem stance saying mr oaten had initially said he accepted mr blunketts word unless further evidence emerged but lib dem officials say mr oaten was speaking when an inquiry was under way and was avoiding rushing to judgement uk set to cut back on embassies nine overseas embassies and high commissions will close in an effort to save money uk foreign secretary jack straw has announced the bahamas east timor madagascar and swaziland are among the areas affected by the biggest shakeup for the diplomatic service for years other diplomatic posts are being turned over to local staff mr straw said the move would save m a year to free up cash for priorities such as fighting terrorism honorary consuls will be appointed in some of the areas affected by the embassy closures nine consulates or consulates general will also be closed mostly in europe and america they include dallas in the us bordeaux in france and oporto in portugal with local staff replacing uk representation in another the changes are due to be put in place before the end of with most savings made from cutting staff and running costs some of the money will have to be used to fund redundancy payments in a written statement mr straw said the savings made will help to underpin higher priority work in line with the foreign and commonwealth offices strategic priorities including counter proliferation counterterrorism energy and climate change some of the savings will also be redeployed to strategic priority work within certain regions where we are closing posts in africa for instance we plan to create new jobs to cover these issues across the region with a new post in nairobi to help support our work on climate change one in nigeria to cover energy and one in pretoria to cover regional issues more generally as well as covering maseru and mbabane the foreign office currently has about ukbased staff it has opened major new missions on baghdad and basra in iraq kabul in afghanistan and pyongyang in north korea since in response to what the government says are changing needs since overseas posts have been closed excluding wednesdays cuts but new embassies or consulates have been opened the shakeup is aimed at helping making m in efficiency savings between and the chancellor has demanded all government departments make similar savings shadow foreign secretary michael ancram said there was a constant need to ensure value for money from foreign missions but the government must give a far clearer reason for making the dramatic changes it has announced and must show that british commercial interests and the interests of britons abroad will not be adversely affected he said blunkett sorry over murder plan david blunkett has apologised to mps after the home office announced prematurely via press release a review of murder laws the home secretary confirmed the review was to get under way in the wake of a law commission report which branded the current murder law as a mess he said the review would look at partial defences to murder including provocation and at mandatory sentences the home office has already said the review will begin next year on wednesday a home office spokeswoman said the terms of reference for the review had not been established but it was likely to include only england and wales news of the review was released because it was thought mr blunkett would make the official announcement in a commons debate on wednesday but the announcement never came with the home secretary saying the debate had never reached that stage amid opposition anger mr blunkett had to answer an emergency question in parliament on thursday he said he had taken steps to ensure the incident was not repeated shadow home secretary david davis welcomed his gracious apology and the review itself but he argued the minister should have volunteered a formal statement instead of having to be dragged to face mps in its report the law commission said it had found wide support among criminal justice professionals for an end to the mandatory life sentence for murder the panel suggested different kinds of murders could be graded to recognise the seriousness of the offence but the home office said mandatory life sentences would not be abolished and argued courts already had flexibility the commission an independent body including two judges a senior barrister and sentencing experts had been asked to consider reforms to the defence of provocation in murder cases but it said its proposals were unlikely to work without a far wider review of the law results of a consultation exercise showed respondents out of among them judges believed a mandatory life sentence for every murder was indefensible and should cease a key question was whether one category should continue to cover all types of murder from mercy killings to serial or contract killings the commission found support for the idea of grading murders so that the sentence reflected the seriousness of the offence but speaking after the report was published home office minister baroness scotland said murder is the most serious of crimes and we have no intention of abolishing the mandatory life sentence where an offender is convicted of murder the court must pass a life sentence the commission also recommended tightening the law so that the provocation defence cannot be used in cases where someone has killed for revenge such as a jealous husband who murders an unfaithful wife hunt demo at labour meeting prohunt supporters are set to protest at labours spring conference the countryside alliance says it expects up to supporters to demonstrate against the hunting ban they have agreed to keep to a demonstration site on the other side of the river tyne from the conference venue in gateshead a bid to overturn the law banning hunting with dogs in england and wales has begun in the court of appeal the ban comes into force on february the court of appeal is expected to rule early next week on whether the alliances challenge has succeeded richard dodd regional director of the countryside alliance said he expected between and supporters in tyneside to make their protest with hunt horns and placards campaigners have been asked not to bring any animals or alcohol mr dodd said he did not believe there would be any repeat of the trouble which marred the prohunt demonstration outside parliament in september we are holding a static demonstration just to remind labour that we are not going away he said northumbria police said the pedestrian millennium bridge by the demonstration site will be shut if necessary but assistant chief constable david warcup has liaised with several protest groups and said all negotiations had gone well fathers justice pensioners rights activists and stop the war campaigners were also expected to demonstrate during the threeday conference which starts on friday prohunt campaigners claims the parliament act which extends the right of the house of commons to overrule the house of lords was itself invalid because it was never passed by peers the high court last month ruled the act was valid and the proposed hunting ban was lawful prohunt supporters formally launched their second legal challenge to the ban in londons high court on thursday the countryside alliance has lodged papers seeking a judicial review on human rights grounds animal welfare groups have welcomed the ban many of whom have campaigned for a ban for decades saying hunting is cruel and unnecessary protesters plan airport challenge campaigners against the expansion of britains airports have begun challenging the governments plans in the high court baas expansion of stansted airport in essex by building an extra runway is one of the most fiercely opposed plans opponents say the bn cost of the new runway could not be met unless cash from heathrow and gatwick was used they said this is illegal under current rules and are trying to block the government from changing legislation baa are also owners of the airports at heathrow and gatwick they have said they cannot raise the money needed for the stansted upgrades from current landing charges baa also says it has attempted to involve communities in any future airport plans groups challenging the plans include stop stansted expansion heathrow antinoise campaigners hacan clearskies and the london boroughs of hillingdon and wandsworth their opponents are also likely to complain there was no public consultation before an extra runway was built at luton airport or when it changed takeoff and landing procedures at heathrow if the group wins the governments future aviation plans outlined in last years transport white paper could be left in ruins the campaigners will say the government did not adequately consider the building of new airports such as one planned for the isle of sheppey east of london lord hanningfield leader of essex county council told bbc radio s today programme we are going to the high court because we want a judge to rule there should be a proper inquiry we want a judge to say there has been inadequate preparation consultation and thought before the government came out with its green paper then there could be a proper debate nationally about where this extra capacity should go he added politicians should not decide where runways should be the stansted expansion apart from the building of the new runway would also need to include new terminal buildings to deal with the projected m passengers who will use it every year the airport is the hub of many of the nofrills airlines operating in the uk but baa has said it has attempted to involve communities in any future airport plans at heathrow gatwick edinburgh and glasgow airports baa launched a series of consultations on blight to properties from the proposed expansion in september which will close next week baa is also offering to buy noisehit properties for an indexlinked unblighted price at heathrow baa said it was working closely with all interested parties to see how the strict environmental air quality and noise targets for a third runway can be met at gatwick the company has written to homes and business likely to be affected by any extra runway tories attack burglar uturns tory leader michael howard has accused tony blair of performing uturns over rules on using force against burglars the government has ruled out amending the present law which allows reasonable force in self defence mr howard branded the decision unacceptable saying it is not householders who should be frightened its the burglars home secretary charles clarke said ministers had kept to their pledge to review the law metropolitan police commissioner sir john stevens last month backed a tory attempt to change the law so only householders using grossly disproportionate force could be prosecuted the pressure prompted the prime minister to say the police and crown prosecution service would be consulted as part of a review of the law he told mps if we get the right response from those people we will of course support a change in the law instead the government has decided no change is needed but there will be a publicity campaign so people are clear they are entitled to defend themselves on thursday mr howard told bbc radio s today programme mr blair had initially refused the law change then had come round to the idea and was now backtracking again he said weve had three policy positions in three months and two uturns its not surprising gordon brown told him theres nothing you could say to me now that i could ever believe mr howard said the grossly disproportionate test matched the hurdle ministers had introduced for civil cases where burglars where claimed compensation from householders the issue entered the public spotlight when norfolk farmer tony martin was jailed for shooting dead a yearold burglar in as he ran away from the farm but the home secretary said mr howard was wrong to say the law was biased in favour of burglars the barrister who had represented mr martin had said the rules were weighted overwhelmingly in favour of the householder said mr clarke he said the problem is there has not been enough understanding of it that was the point sir john stevens was making and the prime minister was making the new guidance would help ensure clarity on the issue added mr clarke the director of public prosecutions ken macdonald says only householders or occupiers of business premises have been prosecuted in the last years those cases included a warehouse manager who had waited for a burglar tied him up beat him and set him alight he said tory mp patrick mercers private members bill to change the law received a first reading in parliament on wednesday and goes to a full debate next month leaders meet over turkish eu bid tony blair has met italian prime minister silvio berlusconi and german chancellor gerhard schroeder to talk about turkey entering the eu the downing street talks covered a range of other topics ahead of an eu summit in brussels later in the week mr blair is an enthusiastic proponent of talks to bring turkey within the recentlyexpanded eu italy and germany also favour an early start to talks but there is scepticism in france and elsewhere some are worried that turkeys large and rapidly growing population and low average income might make integration into the eu difficult some are concerned that a change of government could lead to turkey reneging on key human rights reforms it has recently enacted and many in france would prefer turkey to admit that world war iera killing of armenians constituted genocide there are also issues in france and the netherlands over the possible problems of integrating the first major muslim nation into the eu but mr blair and the labour government have been the staunchest backers of turkish accession provided it sticks with human rights and economic reform mr blairs official spokesman said the prime minister has regular meetings with both of them and particularly in advance of european councils the key issue at this weeks council will be that of turkey but they will also discuss a range of other matters choose hope over fear kennedy voters will have a clear choice between the politics of fear and the politics of hope in the next general election said charles kennedy in his new year message the liberal democrat leader said labour and the conservatives were united in relying on fear and populist scares he said his party was the one of hope and was ready for a poll on the asian tsunami he said it had been very heartening to learn of the generosity being shown by britons mr kennedy said his thoughts were with all those caught up in the disaster which had dominated the christmas and new year period at home he said many people were turning to the liberal democrats as they became disheartened with the politics of the other two main parties the general election would be a threeparty struggle as the conservative party fades away as a national force and the liberal democrats challenge labour in its heartlands he said a clear division is emerging in british politics the politics of fear versus the politics of hope labour is counting on the politics of fear ratcheting up talk of threats crime and insecurity while the conservatives are reworking their populist scares about asylum and the european menace he said he said the government was using this climate of fear to try to strip away civil liberties it was already using detention without trial at belmarsh prison ignoring a recent law lords judgement that this contravenes basic human rights he said he also criticised attempts to bring in trial without jury plans to lower the burden of proof in some criminal trials curbing of rights to protest increased stop and search powers and id card plans he said while everyone had the right to be secure they also had the right to be protected against unfair discrimination but at the same time an overmighty state is a dangerous one he said his party instinctively understood the new liberal britain which is no longer a nation with one family structure and one colour he said we are less deferential more inclined to think for ourselves more open about sexuality and equality our national institutions are changing too we are no longer a nation of one church we are a nation of many faiths in our attitudes and the way we live our lives this is in many ways a liberal britain borders rail link campaign rally campaigners are to stage a rally calling for a borders rail link which was closed in to be reopened they will mark the th anniversary of the line closure which ran from edinburgh through the borders and on to carlisle with a walk at tweedbank anne borthwick of campaign for borders rail said reopening the waverley line would restore the areas prosperity msps are considering the reintroduction of passenger rail services through midlothian to the borders campaigners have said that reopening the waverley line which could cost up to m would be a huge economic boost for the borders in borders council said the areas economy had suffered since the closure ms borthwick said the lobby group was determined to keep the pressure on the scottish executive we are hoping that many people will join us in a march to mark the th anniversary of the closure of the waverley line she said campaign for borders rail is the biggest independent lobby group in scotland and we have been lobbying tirelessly for the reinstatement of rail services to the borders and eventually to carlisle we believe that it is time for the scottish executive to commit to the first phase of the project by pledging to fund the line between edinburgh and tweedbank in the first instance and then investigate extending the line in the future ms borthwick said reopening the line would be a prosperous move and protect the character of the scottish borders a study in which was commissioned by the executive scottish borders council midlothian council and scottish borders enterprise found that a halfhourly service from tweedbank to edinburgh could cover its operating costs it also found that a halfhourly service from gorebridge to edinburgh could cover operating costs and that a freight railway joining the west coast main line at longtown could also be reinstated hitler row over welsh arts cash an artist critical of welsh arts funding being brought under assembly government control has denied comparing the idea with dictatorships in russia and germany shani rhys james is worried that the arts council of wales may be taken over by the welsh assembly government culture minister alun pugh said it would be crass and ignorant to liken a quango review to hitlers germany but ms james emphasised she had actually said artists needed freedom the future of the arts council of wales has been in question since it was announced that most welsh quangos would eventually be abolished it was announced last july that three welsh quangos education and training body elwa the wales tourist board and the welsh development agency would be brought under assembly government control the arts council of wales may be among the next to come under the assembly governments umbrella but ms james who won the jerwood painting prize in said arts funding should be separate from government ms james told bbc radio wales its quite dangerous when you involve politicians because its not like the health service and its not like the railways free expression is absolutely vital in a democratic society you need distance you do not need government interference because it could be taken the wrong way but she said reports that she had likened the assembly government to totalitarian regimes were inaccurate she told good morning wales just to put the record straight that business in the paper where it said i likened the government to bolshevik russia or hitlers germany the actual quote i gave was it is vital to a civilised society that we allow artists to express themselves without government control as we know from past european history ie russia and germany in the early th century artists will go underground or leave the country or rather than compromise their expression artists need a free voice to express themselves they reflect a truth through their own art forms she said the assembly government was not best placed to run the arts in wales she added it would be a momentous change and devastating to the arts it would set the arts scene back years because i really dont think the government has the expertise if you have the national assembly taking control i fear you are going to be going back to the dragons and leeks and the choirs wales has moved on it is international now it is not set back in how green was my valley responding to ms james criticisms mr pugh said the structure of unelected quangos is under review and we have made it clear that further announcements are due shortly comparing the welsh assembly government to hitlers germany is a crass and ignorant response to a real issue about democratic accountability ms james whose father was welsh was born in melbourne where her parents worked in the theatre she moved to powys nearly years ago where she works from her studio near llangadfan she has won a number of arts prizes including the wales open in and the mostyn open in profile david blunkett before he resigned the position of home secretary on wednesday david blunkett had been in charge of a substantial body of government portfolios including race policing and immigration his responsibilities in running the home office included civil emergencies security terrorism and expenditure named home secretary after the general election mr blunkett had seen the focus on his office intensify the attacks on the world trade center on september heightened concern for security and immigration in particular a labour loyalist from a working class background mr blunkett had been unafraid of pushing for tough changes to labour policy recently the issue of identity cards had provoked controversy with questions raised over cost and invasions of civil liberties mr blunkett was also at the centre of a humiliating scandal involving the former immigration minister beverly hughes having received his full backing ms hughes was forced to resign in april over abuses in the visa processing system which she claimed to be unaware of mr blunketts own comments on immigration had prompted censure he told refugees from afghanistan and kosovo to get back home to start rebuilding their countries and he also urged people from ethnic minorities to develop a sense of belonging in britain telling them to speak english at home avoiding political correctness is second nature to the former home secretary who spurns a metropolitan elite and airy fairy libertarians and earlier in the year coined the phrase liberati as an amalgam of glitterati and liberal yet in january of this year he courted further controversy over his seemingly liberal reclassification of cannabis from a grade b to grade c status drug before the recent furore mr blunkett had always appeared more interested in politics than his personal life mr blunkett told the daily telegraph in that he continued to wear his wedding ring in spite of being a divorcee as a useful way of ensuring that people dont casually think i am available he added i am not available because i am just getting on with the job mr blunkett entered parliament for sheffield brightside in after first contesting the sheffield hallam seat in he is one of very few blind mps and was the first to reach the front bench and the cabinet his relaxed performances with his guide dog by his side at the despatch box in the labour partys national executive and on the conference platform made it easy to forget his disability mr blunkett himself described not being able to see as simply an inconvenience using braille for speeches and briefed by his officials on tape he also has a sharp tongue at times and a pragmatic approach to politics mr blunkett was schooled in sheffield where he led the city council for seven years before entering the commons he chaired the labour party nationally and was a unifying force in the s and s shadowing health and education in tony blairs first government mr blunkett was put in charge of education and employment where he won big increases in funds for schools while insisting on improved standards of literacy and numeracy he was prepared to stand up to the teaching unions which sometimes heckled his speeches and his policy of charging university students for tuition fees was not popular in the labour party he has been regarded as a loyal colleague a conciliator who avoids factions and a man whose humour and determination make him widely popular there have been wry smiles as well in his then guide dog lucy threw up in the chamber during the speech of his tory opponent lucy was replaced by her halfsister sadie a black labradorcurlycoated retriever cross in after nearly a decade by mr blunketts side strike threat over pension plans millions of public service workers could strike if ministers scrap their final salary pension scheme and make them work longer warn union leaders the cabinet office has confirmed it is reviewing the current pension system prompting unions representing m workers to threaten united action they believe the plans include raising the mandatory retirement age for public service workers from to the government says unions will be consulted before any changes are made it is thought the proposed overhaul due on thursday could mean pensions could be based on a career average salary for each year served staff currently get one eightieth of their highest salary in the final three years ministers will be anxious to avoid mass strike action in the leadup to the next general election which is widely expected next may in a statement on sunday the cabinet office said it was reviewing the civil service pension scheme and hoped to announce proposals soon unions will of course be consulted about any proposed changes public sector pension schemes need to remain affordable and sustainable people are living longer and pensions are getting more expensive to maintain the longterm affordability of our pension scheme the government announced in its green paper on pensions that pension age would rise from to on monday tony blairs official spokesman declined to say whether the prime minister backed the plans he said whats important is that theres a process going on its out for consultation at the moment lets wait for that process to complete itself there is already widespread anger over the chancellors plans to get rid of more than civil servants now public service unions are united against the plans and the trades union congress is discussing the issue next monday dave prentis general secretary of unison said changes to pension provisions for workers in the public sector would mean they had to pay in more but would still face a raw deal members working in the nhs or for local government have never had high pay or city bonuses but they could look forward to a decent pension now all that is being taken away he said what really riles me is the breathtaking hypocrisy of mps who recently voted themselves the best pension scheme in europe but say they cant afford it for anyone else this is a position that unison cannot accept and will oppose it will lead to conflict between unison and the government if not this year then next mr prentis said workers did not want to go on strike and called for talks between unions and the highest level of government mark serwotka from the public and commercial services union said there should be a coordinated one day strike unless there was a government rethink the fire brigades union said the government was planning to cut ill health retirement benefits for firefighters and other measures to chip away at pensions pensions officer paul woolstenholmes said the pensions of millions of public sector workers are under threat apart from mps and judges who have the most generous pensions arrangements in the country parties warned over grey vote political parties cannot afford to take older uk voters for granted in the coming election says age concern a survey for the charity suggests of overs say they always vote in a general election compared with just of to year olds charity boss gordon lishman said if a decisive blow was struck at the election it would be by older voters who could be relied on to turn out a total of adults aged or over were interviewed for the study mr lishman urged the next government to boost state pension he also called for measures to combat ageism and build effective public services to support us all in an ageing society older people want to see manifesto commitments that will make a difference to their lives mr lishman said political parties must wake up to the fact that unless they address the demands and concerns of older people they will not keep or attract their vote in the survey carried out by icm research of people aged between and said they never voted in general elections among the overs said they would be certain to vote in an immediate election compared with of people under age concern says the overs are united around key areas of policy they want the government to focus on for pensions and the nhs were key issues while the economy

is being looked at to establish whether he abused his position in relation to his exlover the parliamentary standards watchdog is looking at his decision to give kimberly quinn free rail tickets he is also being investigated over the visa application of mrs quinns exnanny the visit to sheffield will be seen as a show of unity by mr blair on wednesday during prime ministers questions tory leader michael howard went on the offensive over comments mr blunkett is alleged to have made in a new biography he is understood to have made a series of criticisms about his cabinet colleagues from the prime minister down mr howard said mr blunkett had complained he had inherited a giant mess when he took over at the home office from jack straw now foreign secretary the tory leader went on he doesnt stop there he thinks the culture secretarys weak he thinks the trade secretary doesnt think strategically and he thinks the education secretary hasnt developed as expected he says the prime minister doesnt like being told the truth and the chancellor no doubt the prime minister will agree with this is a bully mr blair retorted voters remembered the record of a government and no comments by politicians the home secretary has already admitted he was wrong to give the two first class tickets given to him as an mp to mrs quinn and has since paid the back he has apologised for a genuine mistake and says he will write to the watchdog to answer further questions the rail tickets are meant to help mps spouses get between westminster and their constituencies after his inquiry parliamentary watchdog sir philip mawer will report to the commons standards and privileges committee the group of mps who will recommend to the full house of commons what action if any should be taken against mr blunkett the separate inquiry by exsenior civil servant sir alan budd is investigating whether the home secretary helped fasttrack a bid by mrs quinns nanny leoncia casalme to stay in the uk last week mr blunkett won the first round of a high court battle with mrs quinn for access to her son mr blunkett declined to comment about his own position saying the inquiry was under way and the high court had stressed his right to privacy did not affect his job in improving security and stability downing street has stressed mr blairs support for the home secretary student fee factor played down a rise has been recorded in the number of students from south of the border applying to universities in scotland however lifelong learning minister jim wallace said that this would not result in scottish students missing out applications from england and wales rose by between january and the previous year up to fears had been expressed that a flood of fee refugees would try to avoid topup fees of up to a year being introduced in england in june last year mr wallace announced proposals to increase tuition fees for english students studying in scotland by in an attempt to prevent a crossborder flood although no figure has yet been agreed legislation to introduce the topup fees in england is not due to take effect until autumn and students who start before then will not have to pay additional fees at all the figures were made public on thursday by admissions service ucas universities scotland which represents university principals claimed that an increase in applications did not amount to scottish students being squeezed out director david caldwell said some students could be applying in an attempt to avoid the possible increase in annual fees at english universities but this was not a major factor he told bbc radio scotlands good morning scotland programme the reason people are opting for scottish universities is that they are perceived as being of very high quality they offer very attractive courses and scotland is seen as a very attractive place to study they know that when they take up their studies in they will be hit by topup fees if they are going to a university in england and that may be part of the reason why the numbers coming to scotland are so inflated however it does not mean that we will see thousands of additional students from england studying here mr wallace agreed and said the figures had to be looked at in context he explained that when applications were translated into acceptances the number was not huge an additional figure of about also the picture was further blurred by the fact that applications from wales where there are no plans for topup fees have also risen by mr wallace said accepting students from all parts of the world does show the high regard in which scottish higher education is held not just in britain we want to make sure that when students are making their choice they do so on the nature of the course and not because they are under some sort of financial pressure to go to scotland we do not want to have a situation where it becomes impossible for scottish students to get places at scottish universities because we are seen as the cheap option very often the quality of the university experience is enhanced by the fact there are students coming from a wide range of backgrounds so it would be wrong to go the other way and start excluding students anglers could face prosecution anglers and fishermen could find themselves prosecuted under plans to crack down on animal cruelty a committee of mps has warned sloppy wording of the draft animal welfare bill could leave anglers facing court even though it was not intended the environment select committee said the mps said they were concerned the government had not consulted directly on its plans to improve animal welfare they raised complex and emotive issues which needed to be resolved mps said they called for a castiron guarantee that the government consults on any plans to regulate animal industries like pet fairs and game bird rearing the draft bill seeks to modernise and improve animal welfare legislation and intends to protect kept animals and companion animals by setting up a duty of care in addition to maintaining existing cruelty offences it creates an offence of neglect by keepers who fail to protect the animals for whom they are responsible the bill would allow animal welfare officers to intervene to prevent harm to an animal as well as outlawing mutilation of animals unless it can be demonstrated to be in the animals best interest the environment select committee made recommendations after hearing evidence from organisations and individuals one was a call to amend the bill so that prosecutions against those engaged in fishing were not inadvertently encouraged even if they were to later fail we accept that neither commercial fishing nor recreational angling should fall within the remit of the of the draft bill and we therefore support the governments intention to exempt fishing as an activity but the committee said an amendment was needed to ensure cases were not brought however in exempting fishing the government should be careful to ensure that those persons who catch fish are not given carte blanche to inflict unnecessary suffering in the course of pursuing this activity the committee added the committee also said some legal protections for animals were downgraded by the bill such as the law on abandonment of animals which would be significantly weakened mps urged the government to redraft clauses relating to the prosecution of cruelty offences this was because as it stood the draft bill would allow certain acts that should be prosecuted such as unnecessary suffering caused to an animal through neglect or unnecessary mental suffering to go unpunished committee chairman michael jack said any change in the law as it affects animals always arouses powerful emotions and great public interest this draft bill is no exception my committee welcomes the development of an approach to animal welfare which doesnt just wait for a problem to occur but enables action to be taken to protect animals before irreversible suffering takes place but mr jack said the bill very much had the feel of a work in progress and urged the government to guarantee that an obligation to consult will be enshrined in law before it extended legislative plans to areas such as pet fairs circuses and game bird farms the government must work hard to take the rough edges of its initial proposals before the bill is introduced to parliament he added scots smoking ban details set out smokefree areas will save lives and improve scotlands health first minister jack mcconnell has insisted he told the scottish parliament on wednesday that a comprehensive ban on smoking in public places would be introduced by the spring of mr mcconnell said the countrys health rates were lamentable not least because of smoking he said fines of up to would be levied on employers and licences would be removed for noncompliance earlier the scottish executive considered a range of options but agreed unanimously to introduce an allout ban on smoking in public places in a statement to parliament mr mcconnell said that the licensed trade would be asked to join an expert committee prior to the ban coming into force the health arguments far outweighed lingering public disquiet about a complete ban and claims by the licensed trade that jobs would be lost he told msps he said there would be an international marketing campaign whereby tourists can enjoy smoke free environment and the sick man of europe image becomes a thing of the past there are still national habits which hold us back the time has come for this parliament to accelerate improvements in health he declared health rates are lamentable because of a lack of exercise drugs abuse excessive drinking and overeating they all make us one of the most unhealthy countries in europe and too many smoke it is clear that scotland must not be held back by poor public health the single biggest contribution devolved government can make is to reduce the toll of preventable death caused by smoking the legislation will be introduced as part of the health service miscellaneous provisions bill which will be considered by parliament before christmas main points of the plan a comprehensive ban on smoking in all enclosed public places in scotland the legislation will be enforced by environmental health and local licensing officers licensees or employers who fail to enforce the law will face fines up to a maximum of licensees who persistently refuse to comply with the law will face the ultimate sanction of losing their liquor licence a system of issuing fixed penalty notices for those individuals who break the law will be examined individuals who persistently break the law will face a maximum fine of mr mcconnell claimed there was evidence that smoking bans had helped smokers to either give up quicker or smoke less he said there had been falling cigarette sales of in new york and in ireland mr mcconnell added that there had been a near nine per cent rise in tax revenues from new york bars and restaurants and in ireland only a one point three per cent volume sales fall where they were declining before the ban the afternoon announcement following a cabinet meeting on wednesday morning won broad support from opposition parties the scottish national partys holyrood leader nicola sturgeon welcomed the move but added that the public should be consulted as the clock ticked towards the ban date she said the time has come for a ban on smoking in public places there is evidence a ban can cut deaths from passive smoking and makes it easier for the of smokers who desperately want to give up the habit but we must also recognise that some people have concerns and reservations there are people who are yet to be persuaded the scottish conservative party leader david mcletchie questioned what would be exempted from the ban he was keen to know if inmates in scottish prisons would continue to be allowed to smoke mr mcletchie asked would it not be ironic and perhaps entirely typical of the first ministers brave new scotland that the criminals can be smokers but the smokers will become criminals the scottish green partys health spokeswoman eleanor scott said she was pleased scotland would be following the success stories of new york and ireland she believed the majority of people in scotland wanted to go out without having to breathe in harmful tobacco smoke nuclear strike key terror risk the uk and us must realise they cannot prevent all terror attacks and should focus on making sure they are not nuclear strikes says a top academic amitai etzioni a key influence on new labour thinking says the us emphasis on an axis of evil is misplaced the priority should instead be on failing states including russia and pakistan who cannot properly control their nuclear material he argues his report demands a major overhaul of world rules on nuclear technology professor etzioni was a senior adviser to president carters white house and is the guru behind communitarian ideas which influenced the development of blairite third way politics in a report for the foreign policy centre think tank he says a nuclear terrorist attack is the main danger faced by many nations attempts to defend against it by hardening domestic targets cannot work nor can one rely on preemption by taking the war to the terrorists before they attack he says that means there is an urgent need to curb terrorists access to nuclear arms and the materials used to make them we must recognise that we will be unable to stop all attacks and thus ensure terrorists will not be able to strike with weapons of mass destruction prof etzioni continues he suggests socalled rogue states such as iran and north korea are less of a problem than failed and failing states which are more likely to be a source of nuclear materials he names russia as the failing state of gravest concern as it has an estimated of all fissile material outside america and he is also worried about pakistan after one of its top nuclear scientists abdul qadeer khan admitted leaking nuclear secrets prof etzioni criticises the us for overlooking those reports suggesting it was done in return for pakistani help in hunting osama bin laden this is like letting a serial killer go because he promised to catch some jaywalkers he says upgrading security at nuclear arms stores as a temporary measure creating a new global safety authority to tackle nuclear terrorism using the intelligence links established in the wake of september backed by the united nations authority encouraging pressuring and using all available means to persuade countries to switch their highlyenriched uranium for less dangerous lessenriched uranium when possible taking fissile material away from failing states to safe havens where it can be blended down or converted compelling failing and rogue states and eventually all states to destroy their nuclear bombs russian exspy on hunger strike an exrussian intelligence officer who risked his life spying for mi is entering the seventh week of a hunger strike near downing street viktor makarov claims he has been betrayed by the british authorities who promised he would live like an average british citizen but despite a settlement four years ago he says he has been denied defector status and a decent pension other exrussian spies have been given civil service pensions hunger strike is a weapon of last resort it can work only with determination and of course the realisation of the righteousness of your case without that it will not work mr makarov told the bbcs newsnight programme since i came to this country two batches of promises have been made and broken one after the other oleg gordievsky a senior kgb officer who became a secret agent for the british said he was very happy with the way the government have treated him since him since he defected in commenting on mr makarovs case he said the british state is not a fat cow it is impossible to come here and demand give me more money every week but mr makarovs case has been backed by david kahn a former yale historian and a leading expert on codebreaking who has confirmed his information was valuable to the western allies i believe the government of the united kingdom which in that respect was probably the same as most other power authorities took the information that victor makarov had wrung him dry and left him to hang out in the cold mr kahn said mr makarov joined the kgb in s russia as an idealistic yearold one of his fellow pupils at intelligence school was vladimir putin at kgb headquarters in moscow he was posted to the secret th directorate which decoded intercepted diplomatic traffic from the west by the s he had risen to the rank of senior lieutenant and was privy to the thoughts of western powers but he had became deeply disenchanted with the soviet regime fuelled by its repression both at home and in poland through his english teacher he made an approach to m and then began passing secrets to the british intelligence service he spied for mi for two years before being betrayed by a friend and sent to perm a soviet hard labour camp in the artic circle within a week of his release in he made contact with the british authorities hed been spying for who arranged a meeting between him and an mi agent in latvia he was given a false passport and he says promised that he would be given the chance to live like an average uk citizen but after arriving in london years ago he feels this promise has not been fulfilled after long periods of living in bedsits with deteriorating health four years ago he took legal action against the government and settled for to buy a small house but he says he will remain on hunger strike until he receives a decent pension and the right to work something he feels he has been denied because the authorities do not trust him government sources told the bbc they had reached a final settlement with the former spy which he has been able to appeal to security and intelligence tribunals kelly trails new discipline power teachers could get more powers to remove unruly pupils from classes under a zero tolerance drive education secretary ruth kelly has suggested ms kelly told the bbc progress had been made against severely disruptive children but parents were still worried about lower level problems the minister also confirmed she received spiritual support from the catholic movement opus dei but she denied her faith meant she would refuse key government jobs the conservatives have made school discipline one of their five priority areas in the runup to the next general election ms kelly is expected to announce her plans on the issue in the next fortnight she told bbc ones breakfast with frost it is really important to support head teachers and teachers in tackling disruption in the classroom we have made huge progress on the really difficult cases the pupils who have severely disruptive behaviour but quite rightly what teachers are concerned about and what parents are concerned about is that this lower level disruption that goes on in the classroom now is tackled i would like to see the teacher being able to remove disruptive children from the classroom completely and have either alternative provision within the school or indeed off the school and may be working together with other schools in a particular area to provide that provision it is thought the plans may distinguish between excluding pupils from schools and taking them out of mainstream classes head teachers can currently exclude pupils who commit or threaten violence in school who sexually abuse pupils or other people who sell illegal drugs or who have persistent and malicious disruptive behaviour ms kelly entered the cabinet last month in the reshuffle forced by the resignation of the then home secretary david blunkett her links to opus dei which means work of god in latin have provoked controversy critics say the organisation which adheres strictly to catholic teachings is secretive and elitist but its members reject such claims asked if she was a member of the group ms kelly said i do have spiritual support from opus dei and that is right but those are private spiritual matters and im sure youll respect that politicians are entitled to a private life she categorically denied reports that her beliefs on issues such as contraception would make her refuse to serve as a health or international development minister her collective responsibility as a cabinet minister meant she also took responsibility for policies in those areas she argued the government has yet to issue its official response to the tomlinson review which recommended absorbing existing exam qualifications into a diploma ms kelly said reforms should build on gcses and alevels her comments did not impress tory shadow education secretary tim collins ruth kelly wants to ditch the tomlinson report on exam structures but has absolutely no idea what to put in its place he said she also talks of improving discipline but cannot make her mind up how this is an all talk agenda that lets down children teachers and parents citizenship event for s touted citizenship ceremonies could be introduced for people celebrating their th birthday charles clarke has said the idea will be tried as part of an overhaul of the way government approaches inclusive citizenship particularly for ethnic minorities a pilot scheme based on ceremonies in australia will start in october mr clarke said it would be a way of recognising young people reaching their voting age when they also gain greater independence from parents britains young black and asian people are to be encouraged to learn about the nations heritage as part of the governments new race strategy which will also target specific issues within different ethnic minority groups officials say the home secretary wants young people to feel they belong and to understand their other cultural identities alongside being british the launch follows a row about the role of faith schools in britain on monday school inspection chief david bell accused some islamic schools of failing to teach pupils about their obligations to british society the muslim council of britain said ofsted boss mr bells comments were highly irresponsible the home office started work on its community cohesion and race equality strategy last year and the outcome launched on wednesday is called improving opportunity strengthening society it is aimed at tackling racism exclusion segregation and the rise in political and religious extremism it represents a move away from the onesizefitsall approach to focus on specifics within cultural groups said a home office spokesman it is not right to say that if you are from a black or ethnic minority group you must be disadvantaged the spokesman highlighted specific issues that affect particular communities for example people of south asian origin tend to suffer from a high incidence of heart disease it is about drilling down and focusing on these sorts of problems the spokesman added launching the initiative mr clarke said enormous progress had been made on race issues in recent years he added but while many members of black and minority ethnic communities are thriving some may still find it harder to succeed in employment or gain access to healthcare education or housing this strategy sets out the governments commitment to doing more to identify and respond to the specific needs of minorities in our society some of the uk population described themselves as coming from a nonwhite ethnic minority in the census the downing street strategy unit in said people from indian and chinese backgrounds were doing well on average often outperforming white people in education and earnings but those of pakistani bangladeshi and black caribbean origin were significantly more likely to be unemployed and earn less than whites it said the home office wants more initiatives which try to promote a sense of belonging by encouraging young people to take part in voluntary work the programmes are designed to support the citizenship lessons already taking place in schools england childrens tsar appointed the first childrens commissioner for england has been appointed great ormond street hospital professor of child health al aynsleygreen was chosen by the government and will start the ayear job immediately he will oversee a m annual budget and have the power to look into any matter relating to the interests and wellbeing of children prof aynsleygreen has also been the national clinical director for children in the department of health he promised to make sure that childrens opinions count i will be drawing on my experience of working with children and young people to help ensure that those with the power to improve childrens lives do live up to their responsibilities i want all children and young people to know that they can approach me to discuss any matter that affects them knowing that i will value their opinion education secretary ruth kelly said prof aynsleygreen would strengthen the voice of children and young people prof aynsleygreen was a lecturer at oxford university trained at guys hospital medical school university of london oriel college oxford and in switzerland he is described as a proud grandfather of four scotland wales and northern ireland already have childrens commissioners eu china arms ban to be lifted the eu embargo on arms exports to china is likely to be lifted in the next six months despite us objections uk foreign secretary jack straw has said the yearold ban was imposed in the aftermath of chinas crackdown on protesters in tiananmen square mr straw told a commons select committee human rights concerns over china remained but he said it was wrong to put china under the same embargo as countries such as zimbabwe and burma in december the eu pledged to work towards lifting the ban but said it was not ready to do so yet the eus move was welcomed at the time by beijing which described the embargo as a product of the cold war german chancellor gerhard schroeder and french president jacques chirac have repeatedly called for the embargo to be lifted britain has been more cautious on the issue but on wednesday mr straw said he also wanted it to end i have long understood chinas argument that to lump them in with say burma and zimbabwe is not appropriate and i dont think it is he told the joint committee on strategic export controls he said it is more likely than not that the ban would be lifted before britain takes over the presidency of the eu from luxembourg in july but he said an eu code of conduct would prevent an increase in the number of arms being exported to the country if it is lifted we will end up with as effective arms controls in relation to china as we have now mr straw said the us government was suspicious of the motives of some other countries within the eu in wanting the ban lifted but he said many of washingtons objections were based on a lack of information and understanding of how export control guidelines worked in eu countries and intense discussions were taking place with us officials to convince them it was the right thing to do washington is thought to fear it would lead to a buying spree for arms that could be used by china to threaten its diplomatic rival taiwan us officials say they are not satisfied the mechanisms in the eu code of conduct are robust enough to prevent abuses us undersecretary of state john bolton is meeting british officials this week to press the case for keeping the embargo debate needed on donations cap a cap on donations to political parties should not be introduced yet the elections watchdog has said fears that big donors can buy political favours have sparked calls for a limit in a new report the electoral commission says it is worth debating a cap for the future but now is not the right time to introduce it it also says there should be more state funding for political parties and candidates should be able to spend more on election campaigning there were almost m in reported donations to political parties in and with nearly m of them from individual gifts worth more than m the rules have already been changed so the public can see who gives how much to the parties but the report says there are still public suspicions the commission says capping donations would mean taxpayers giving parties more cash something which would first have to be acceptable to the public and shown to work while we are not in principle opposed to the introduction of a donation cap we do not believe that such a major departure from the existing system now would be sensible says its report if there was to be a cap it should be a small enough amount to make a difference but which would have banned m in donations between and even without changes the commission does urge political parties to seek out more smallscale donations and suggests there should be income tax relief for gifts under it also suggests increasing state funding for parties to m so help can be extended to all parties with at least two members in the house of commons european parliament scottish parliament welsh assembly or northern ireland assembly and it suggests new ways of boosting election campaigning seen as a way of improving voter turnout all local election candidates should be entitled to a free mailshot for campaign leaflets says the watchdog and there should be a shift in the amount of money allowed to be spent at elections from a national level to a local level to help politicians engage better with voters the report suggests doubling the money which can be spent by candidates while cutting national spending limits from m to m the commission also says the spending limits for general elections should cover the four months before the poll as happens with other elections electoral commission chairman sam younger said there is no doubt that political parties have a vital role to play in maintaining the health of our democracy and for this they need to be adequately resourced our research has shown that people want to be more informed about party politics and that they want politicians to be more visible and accessible the public are reluctant for the state to fund parties but at the same time are unhappy with large private donations he called for a wider public debate on party funding to find the consensus needed for radical changes to the current system cardinal criticises iraq war cost billions of pounds spent on conflict in iraq and in the middle east should have been used to reduce poverty cardinal cormac murphyoconnor has said the head of the catholic church in england and wales made the comments on bbc radio and will reiterate his stance in his christmas midnight mass the cardinal used a christmas message to denounce the war in iraq as a terrible waste of money he and the archbishop of canterbury have both spoken out about the war speaking on bbc radio s thought for the day slot he criticised the fact that billions have been spent on war instead of being used to bring people out of dire poverty and malnourishment and disease the cardinal said should be the year for campaigning to make history poverty he added if the governments of the rich countries were as ready to devote to peace the resources they are willing to commit to war that would be to see with new eyes and speak with a new voice and perhaps then others would listen to us with new ears the cardinal will touch on this theme again on friday night when he will tell the congregation of at westminster cathedral that peace is worth always striving for how is it that peace has not arrived the cardinal will ask how is it that there is war in iraq violence in the holy land and the horror of pain and death amongst the poor and deprived who suffer from injustice and thus do not find peace how can one wish a happy christmas for our fellow christians in iraq or in the holy land or those who suffer in africa unless you and i in whatever way is open to us say and do what makes for peace both the cardinal and archbishop of canterbury dr rowan williams appealed for the weapons inspectors to be given more time in iraq before the war started dr williams has since criticised the government over its case for war saying the failure to find weapons of mass destruction had damaged faith in the political system on friday the cardinal will ask the congregation to search for peace it is possible it is real it is worth always striving for because of the promise of our saviour he will say i also wish you peace in your homes because peace in your home is the beginning of peace in the homes of the community a spokesman said downing street had no comment to make but prime minister tony blair has said he will put africa at the top of the agenda when britain chairs the g summit next year assembly ballot papers missing hundreds of ballot papers for the regional assembly referendum in the north east have disappeared royal mail says it is investigating the situation which has meant about homes in county durham are not receiving voting packs officials at darlington council are now in a race against time to try and rectify the situation the allpostal votes of about two million electors are due to be handed in by november a spokesman for darlington council said we have sent out the ballot papers the problem is with royal mail somewhere along the line something has gone wrong and these ballot papers have not been delivered the royal mail is investigating to see if they can find out what the problem is a spokeswoman for royal mail said we are investigating a problem with the delivery route in the mowden area of darlington this is affecting several hundred properties which have failed to receive ballot papers we are working closely with the council and will do all we can to help rectify the problem noone will not receive their ballot paper as special hand deliveries will take place where necessary we are unaware of any other problems of this kind to do with the regional assembly vote the darlington council spokesman added initially we had complaints from a couple of residents in mowden to say they thought they should have had their ballot papers by now we then made further investigations and it became clear this was a bigger issue a spokeswoman for the electoral commission told bbc news online that letters were being sent out to those homes affected she said the commission was satisfied that measures had been put in place to ensure all voters received ballot papers in time so far a total of ballot envelopes have been scanned by bar code at counting offices across the north east muslims discuss election concerns issues that muslims should be considering before voting in the next general election are to be debated by uk community representatives the event is being held by the muslim association of britain mab which believes muslim voters could influence the result in up to constituencies last year mab which opposed the war in iraq urged muslims not to vote for labour in the european elections but a spokesman stressed the meeting was not necessarily antilabour this meeting is not antiparty in particular its antipolicy its on the issues we are going to ask muslims to vote on mab spokesman dr azzam tamimi said of tuesdays event there are issues of concern to muslims and muslims generally agree on them but have not in the past been aware of how a vote can serve these issues dr tamimi said the main issues muslims should consider were what he referred to as the war on iraq the palestinian situation the erosion of civil liberties for muslims in the uk and economic social and education problems approximately m of the uks m muslims are of voting age previous election research has shown the overwhelming majority have traditionally voted labour but more recent studies have suggested labour support has been falling away significantly among some muslim voters anger over the war in iraq has appeared to be the main reason with many saying it was unjustified representatives from a number of muslim organisations will attend tuesdays event among them will be the muslim council of britain mcb the chairman of the mcbs public affairs committee sher khan said the war in iraq would be a significant factor affecting muslims voting intentions i think its going to be quite significant because of the number of seats in which they could have an impact mr khan said however professor john curtice of the university of strathclyde is sceptical about how much difference tactical voting by muslims could make for the most part the labour constituencies where theres a large muslim community are relatively safe but there are one or two that are not quite so safe professor curtice said the constituencies where labour was most at risk from a muslim tactical vote were bethnal green in east london and rochdale in lancashire he added in bethnal green former labour mp george galloway who founded the antiwar party respect is standing against sitting mp oona king who had a vote majority in in rochdale the liberal democrats the mainstream party a icm survey showed was benefiting most from muslim disaffection with labour secured second place in the election securing just under votes fewer than labours lorna fitzsimons but professor curtice said the muslim antiwar vote could be split between the liberal democrats and respect meaning neither would benefit much at the ballot box ironically the tories might be the beneficiaries if labour does lose seats which is generally the case he said but dr tamimi said mabs intention was not to empower the tories we know the next government will be labour but we are aiming to send a message that it will make a difference if the muslims use their vote properly if the next labour government has a reduced majority thats a great achievement because having a very big majority has been very harmful for politics in this country dr tamimi said drive to save festive holidays efforts are being made to protect workers days off on christmas day and new years day support is being sought for a bill which would ensure that large retailers in scotland remain closed on christmas day and january the usdaw trade union said shop workers should be able to enjoy a break with their families msp karen whitefield wants to ensure only those whose roles are essential are at work over the festive season in recent years more stores have been opening on traditional holidays with some starting their endofyear sale on christmas day or new years day ms whitefield said i have found members of the public to be very supportive when i have been campaigning on the streets the early evidence shows quite clearly that the vast majority of people believe that shop workers should be given these two special days to spend with friends and family usdaw general secretary john hannett added christmas day and new years day are special days for everyone in scotland and the fact that shops do not open is an important part of making them special they are largely collective days of rest we want people to tell karen through her consultation whether they want the special nature of these days to remain or whether they want them to become like any other trading day with shops open for business as usual the consultation on a christmas new years day trading bill has so far attracted almost responses and closes on february blair hails turkeyeu talks deal tony blair has hailed a deal bringing turkey a step closer to eu membership as important for the worlds future peace and prosperity mr blair has been a leading advocate of turkish membership despite controversy surrounding the idea leaving a brussels summit mr blair said the fact turkey is a muslim country does not mean it should be barred the deal to open formal talks with ankara came despite an eu demand for turkey to recognise cyprus it was agreed the issue can be tackled at a later date but turkish premier recep erdogan had to accept negotiations did not guarantee his country full eu membership if it joins turkey may have to accept restrictions to limit migration by its citizens mr blair said having turkey in the eu was of importance to the future peace and prosperity of my country britain and the wider world we are stating a fundamental principle that the fact turkey is a muslim country does not mean it should be barred from europe on the contrary if it fulfils the same principles of human rights then muslim and christian can work together under the agreement turkey must issue a written statement promising to sign an accord effectively recognising the greek cypriot government but gives turkey more time to sell the idea to its people the internationally recognised southern part of cyprus is an eu member but turkey which occupies northern cyprus had previously insisted it would not bow to demands to recognise the country calling the issue a red line it could take up to years before turkey is able to join and entry cannot be guaranteed the eu has also announced that it will start accession talks with croatia in april however talks will begin only if the country cooperates fully with the un war crimes tribunal for the former yugoslavia commons hunt protest charges eight protesters who stormed the house of commons chamber during a debate on the hunting bill have been charged with disorderly conduct the men were arrested in september after bursting into the chamber causing a hunting ban debate to be halted those charged included otis ferry the yearold son of rock star bryan ferry and luke tomlinson a close friend of princes william and harry they were charged under section of the public order act police said five of the eight men held an impromptu news conference outside charing cross police station on monday evening after the charges were formerly put to them the mens solicitor matthew knight said that at no time had it occurred to the men that they were committing a criminal offence there is no offence of trespassing in the house of commons it is not a criminal offence he said if parliament wanted to make entering the house of commons chamber on foot a criminal offence it should have done so but it cant do so retrospectively we are not prosecuted for that we are prosecuted for a public order act offence we are not guilty of it they will appear at bow street magistrates court on december a police spokesman said otis ferry a former eton pupil and joint leader of the south shropshire hunt said i have no regrets we have done nothing wrong beyond the obvious which was to stand up for our rights and not act like a sheep like the rest of the country one of the men david redvers from hartpury gloucestershire said he and the other seven protesters would plead not guilty to the charges the other protesters are john holliday a huntsman from ledbury herefordshire robert thame who plays polo with princes charles in team highgrove auctioneer andrew elliot from bromesberrow near ledbury pointtopoint jockey richard wakeham from york and former royal chef nick wood the september protest came on the same day as a huge prohunting demonstration in parliament square four of the men ran out from behind the speakers chair while another wrestled past a doorkeeper from a different entrance the five tried to confront mps before they were bundled out of the chamber and later led away handcuffed by police three others had been intercepted by security staff as they tried to join the five in the chamber speaker michael martin later said the men had used a forged letter to gain access to the house of commons and had been helped to get close to the chamber by a parliamentary pass holder in november the use of the parliament act meant a total ban on hunting with dogs in england and wales however many prohunt activists remained defiant after the law was passed saying they would ignore the ban and continue to hunt last week the countryside alliance said more than hunts would meet legally the day after the ban on hunting with dogs comes into force the alliance said the february meets would show the new law was impossibly difficult to determine and open to different interpretations child access laws shakeup parents who refuse to allow former partners contact with their children could be electronically tagged under plans being considered by ministers curfews and community service orders were other options which could be used if court orders to allow parental access were defied lord falconer said the constitutional affairs secretary outlined some of the plans on tuesday he denied fathers activists had forced the changes telling the bbc there is a recognition that something is wrong between and couples go to court to resolve access disputes each year although in nine out of separations there is no court intervention lord falconer told bbc radio s today programme he hoped voluntary mediation could help solve disputes before they reached court but he opposed compulsory mediation saying that it would lead to many people taking part with the wrong attitude other plans include parenting plans to give advice on access arrangements based on reallife examples that have worked in the past extending incourt conciliation more informal hearings before contested court cases better access to legal emotional and practical advice by telephone and internet legal aid changes to give incentives for early resolution of disputes judges can already jail parents who breach contact orders but that was a nuclear option which was rarely used as it was not seen as being in the childs interests a spokesman said the aim of the new legislation was to provide a medium range of penalties such as fines community service orders compulsory anger management or parenting classes or curfews failure to comply with these measures could result in offenders being electronically tagged on the possibility of tagging uncooperative parents lord falconer said tagging may be going too far but lets have a debate about that full details of the new powers will not be revealed until a bill is published in the next two weeks a spokesman said the governments proposals have met with disapproval from fathers rights groups john ison from the controversial group fathers justice said it is very disappointing what we have got is a cynical case of recycling existing legislation jim parton from families need fathers said the new proposals lacked compulsion we would like to see couples develop a plan and then have it as a source of a court order then you know where you stand you know what the minimum access is otherwise you see people make agreements which then fall apart mr parton said he had been told by childrens minister margaret hodge there was not enough time to pass the bill through parliament before the general election which is likely to take place in may the conservatives have called for an equal split between parents on access to be made law theresa may shadow secretary for the family told bbc radio s today programme that the governments plans were inadequate and were papering over the cracks of the current system she said a conservative government would bring a radical reform of the family courts as well as enforcing a legal presumption of coparenting and compulsory mediation we want to make courts the last resort rather than the first resort she added the government says children cannot simply be divided up like property when a marriage collapses the liberal democrats have argued for flexibility in deciding access rules rather than having rigid targets mps to debate euthanasia laws mps are preparing to debate a bill which critics claim would legalise euthanasia by the back door the bill would give legal force to living wills where people say they want medical treatment withheld if they become severely incapacitated the mental capacity bill has broad support from charities who say it would give better safeguards over treatment but christian groups say it could mean doctors withholding food and fluids even if they think it inappropriate ministers insist the mental capacity bill for england and wales would not change laws on assisted suicide and contains a presumption in favour of preserving life the bill would establish a legal presumption that everybody can make decisions about their own treatment unless proved otherwise it would allow people to give somebody the power of attorney to make decisions on their behalf which could be challenged by doctors critics fear it could allow killing by omission through withdrawing treatment an amendment to the bill specifically preventing decisions that would bring about death has been tabled by former conservative leader iain duncan smith ninety one mps have signed a petition backing the amendment mps could vote on it later on tuesday during the bills report stage debate the bill will then go to a third reading and be debated in the lords before becoming law the christian medical fellowship cmf and lawyers christian fellowship lcf said the mental capacity bill would allow euthanasia by the back door peter saunders of the cmf said it believed advance refusals should be only advisory not legally binding cmf is concerned that patients will make unwise and hasty advance decisions to refuse food and fluids without being properly informed about the diagnosis and the expected course their illness will take he said the lcfs andrea williams said there were too many loopholes that could be abused by unscrupulous doctors exlabour minister frank field told bbc twos newsnight programme there was a danger people would feel under pressure to do away with themselves so relatives could inherit their assets constitutional affairs minister david lammy said laws affecting people with dementia needed updating mr lammy told bbc news labour mps would not get a free vote as the law was being strengthened not changed we are against euthanasia we are against assisted suicide but we are in a situation now where people can make living wills and that has the force of the common law he said doctors are saying they want more clarity patients are saying they want more clarity the making decisions alliance which includes the alzheimers society age concern mencap and the national autistic society said misunderstandings over the bill had to be cleared up it will not change the current law on euthanasia and will actually provide a series of better safeguards when decisions are made for people who lack capacity the alliance said in a statement the british medical association also backs the bill saying it just gives incapacitated people the same rights as others debate on legalising euthanasia has intensified in the uk because of cases like that of motor neurone patient diane pretty she died two years ago after losing a legal battle to allow her husband to help her commit suicide talks aim to avert pension strike talks aimed at averting a series of national strikes over pensions reforms will take place this weekend five public sector unions will hold private talks with deputy prime minister john prescott at labours spring conference in gateshead they want the government to withdraw regulations due to be introduced in weeks which would raise the pension age for council workers from to up to m workers could take part in a strike already earmarked for march however all sides are anxious to avoid a major confrontation in the run up to the general election said bbc labour affairs correspondent stephen cape in four days britains biggest union unison will start balloting local government workers on strikes other public sector unions have pledged to follow it is just weeks before new regulations are introduced to raise the pension age of local government workers the five unions meeting mr prescott want the government to withdraw these regulations this would allow months of tough negotiations to follow said our correspondent but a spokesman for mr prescott warned that the changes to the local government pension scheme would have to go ahead in april privately ministers believe this will be the less painful option our correspondent added the public and commercial services union pcs will coordinate any industrial action with up to six other public sector unions pcs leader mark serwotka warned last week that there could be further walkouts unless there was a government rethink for a government that lectures everyone on choice choice on public service choice on this and choice on that isnt it ironic that theyre saying to public sector workers there is no choice he said if you want the pension you were promised when you started you must work for an extra five years that is working until people drop in the th century its completely unacceptable unisons workers the transport and general workers unions and amicus are among those being balloted about a march walkout mr prescott held a private meeting with senior union figures last week it is understood no deal was offered in that meeting but there was room for further negotiations opposition grows to house arrests the conservatives have expressed serious misgivings about government plans for keeping uk and foreign terror suspects under house arrest michael howard said he would not back the home secretarys plans for control orders which include home detention i do not believe that anyone should be deprived of their liberty on the say so of a politician he said the lib dems also oppose the proposals but ministers insist they are proportionate to the terror threat the government proposed the idea and a range of other new powers after the laws lords said current detentions without trial broke human rights laws new metropolitan police commissioner sir ian blair has backed the control orders saying im sorry it is a dilemma but there is only one choice but mr howard said we have serious misgivings about both their effectiveness in protecting life and their consequences for the british way of life he argued that people accused of terrorist offences should be brought to trial and be held in prison not at home while they await trial mr howard said he feared internment without trial creates martyrs and could be a very effective recruiting sergeant for terrorists his party plans to move an amendment to the serious organised crime and police bill next week that would give a judge responsibility for assessing evidence and ensuring a balanced case is presented to the court he called on the prime minister to enter into constructive discussions with his party to find a better way forward controversy over the issue continues after a foreign terror suspect held in the uk without trial or charge since december was freed from jail home secretary charles clarke said there was not enough evidence to keep the egyptian man known only as c certified as a terrorist suspect on monday the legal team for two algerian suspects being held without trial told a court the men did not want bail if it meant being put under house arrest most of the terror suspects are detained at belmarsh prison in london the liberal democrats say they also oppose house arrests and questioned the human rights implications of the measure home affairs spokesman mark oaten told bbc radio s today programme its a matter of principle for us that we cant have a situation where the home secretary is able to impose house detention now on uk nationals as well as foreign nationals the lib dems believe the home secretary should allow phone tapping evidence in prosecutions we think there could be a role for some form of control order tagging surveillance limitation on use of mobile phones but not with the home secretarys say so that must be done with a proper judicial process a judge involved in making those decisions said mr oaten mr clarke has rejected that idea saying intercept evidence is only a small part of the case against terror suspects and could put the lives of intelligence sources at risk he said prosecutions were the governments first preference and promised the powers would only be used in serious cases with independent scrutiny from judges visa decision every minutes visa processing staff are sometimes expected to rule on an application every minutes mps have said pressure was placed on staff to be efficient rather than to do a thorough examination of an application the public accounts committee found every officer had an annual target of applications equivalent to a day or one every minutes mps want research into whether uk visa holders leave at the end of their stays or vanish into the black market committee chairman edward leigh said there is a worrying tension between quick processing and proper control over the visas issued entry clearance staff are expected to deal with a visa application in about minutes which is surely too little time to look closely at the supporting documents the committees report also discussed the romanian and bulgarian visas scandal which led to the resignation of immigration minister beverley hughes last year committee members said the home office had been wrong to dismiss concerns from visa staff abroad who feared the system was being abused investigations carried out in the wake of ms hughes resignation found more than people had entered the uk under the business visa scheme for romanian and bulgarian entrepreneurs mr leigh said the home office should now consider removing those who had not set up a valid business a home office spokesman said the system had been toughened and tightened since the investigation he added that the traditional system of a dual decision making process for all preentry applications will be replaced by a single preentry check at post which will be simpler and more robust against abuse than the current system no more concessions on terror charles clarke says he has no desire to offer more concessions on his controversial antiterror plans to get them on to the statute book mps voted in favour of the prevention of terrorism bill after mr clarke agreed to key changes but labours majority was reduced to the bill now faces opposition from peers angry at house arrest proposals lord strathclyde tory leader in the lords said ministers should expect it to be substantially rewritten the bill proposes control orders which as well as house arrest could impose curfews tagging or bans on telephone and internet use they would replace current powers to detain foreign terror suspects without trial which the law lords have ruled against on monday mps voted in favour of the bill after key concessions from mr clarke the government earlier saw its strong majority cut to just as a crossparty amendment was narrowly rejected by the commons despite the support of labour rebels mr clarke won over critics by announcing he would introduce an amendment in the lords to ensure the most controversial control order amounting to house arrest would be imposed by judges and not politicians lord strathclyde warned ministers that they should prepare themselves for substantial rewriting of various aspects of the bill they should consider far more seriously the use of intercept evidence in any trial and i think they should drop the most objectionable proposals which are for house arrest but mr clarke told bbc radio s today programme he believed the changes he had made to the bill to win over critics in the commons should be sufficient to satisfy colleagues in the lords no bill goes through parliament without detailed consideration being made but i believe that what i announced yesterday will be sufficient to secure the agreement of the house of lords he said i have no desire to make further socalled concessions on the bill mr clarkes proposed amendment will be debated by the lords on tuesday without having been considered by mps the debate is unlikely to result in a vote speaking after the commons debate shadow home secretary david davies said the bill had been clearly very badly drawnup and that the government was trying to rush it through too quickly he said it would be possible to rescue the government and make the law tolerable by amending it in the lords the scope for miscarriages of justice is enormous he told bbc news mark oaten for the liberal democrats said monday nights vote showed the government had lost the confidence of all sides of the house he said they need to rethink the bill and extend the power of a judge to decide on all control orders build safeguards on evidence and create charges against suspects unless there is a major movement this bill is doomed to fail bbc news political editor andrew marr said i think that this is a bill in deep trouble its been unravelling in the house of commons it may unravel further the government wants the new bill to pass into law by march when the current powers expire boris opposes mayor apology ken livingstone should stick to his guns and not apologise for his nazi comment to a jewish reporter tory mp boris johnson has insisted mr johnson also claimed tony blairs intervention in the row was an attempt to reassure jewish voters london mayor mr livingstone says he is standing by his remarks which likened an evening standard journalist to a concentration camp guard but the prime minister says it is time for mr livingstone to say sorry labours mr livingstone has said his comments may have been offensive but were not racist and said earlier this week he would not apologise even if mr blair asked later the prime minister said a lot of us in politics get angry with journalists from time to time but in the circumstances and to the journalist because he was a jewish journalist yes he should apologise however mr johnson who was forced to apologise last year for an article in the magazine he edits about liverpudlians grieving over the death of british hostage ken bigley said mr blair should butt out of the row i dont see why the prime minister has to get involved in this the spectator editor told bbc radio s today programme its a dispute between ken livingstone and a reporter on the evening standard mr johnson mp for henleyonthames oxfordshire said he suspected labour was now trying to reassure jewish voters because of this curious way in which labour seems to be trying to curry favour with disillusioned muslim voters who may be disillusioned about the war ken doesnt think hes got anything to say sorry for and if thats really his feeling then i think that he should stick to his guns he said mr johnson apologised last october for perpetuating an outdated stereotype of liverpool in the leader article on the death of mr bigley the article in the magazine suggested grieving liverpudlians were wallowing in their victim status it also attributed blame to drunken liverpool football fans for the hillsborough disaster in which died mr johnson told today its perfectly true that i got into the grovelling game myself and when i apologised there were some things that i felt i ought to say sorry for there were also other things i didnt think i should apologise for he said but heres old ken hes been crass hes been insensitive and thuggish and brutal in his language but i dont think actually if you read what he said although it was extraordinary and rude i dont think he was actually antisemitic report attacks defence spending the ministry of defence has been criticised over the soaring spending costs and growing delays of its top equipment projects a national audit office report on the biggest projects says costs have risen by bn in the past year it says there is little evidence the mods performance had improved despite the introduction of a smart acquisition policy six years ago a senior defence official told the bbc lessons were being learned the naos annual report showed the total cost of the projects covered was expected to reach bn higher than originally planned the total delays amounted to months with average individual delays rising by three months sir john bourn head of the nao said the problems showed the principles of the scheme known as smart acquisition had not been consistently applied many problems can be traced to the fact that the mod has not spent enough time and resources in the assessment phase the report says the nao found that projects launched since the start of the scheme were showing the same worrying tendencies as the older legacy projects such as the eurofighter a senior defence official speaking to the bbcs defence correspondent paul adams said that although the figures were still not good enough the report reflected unrealistic expectations early on in the project cycle this years overspend was significantly less than last years bn total and the defence procurement agency which is responsible for buying defence equipment was improving lord bach minister for defence procurement said he was obviously still disappointed with the cost and time increases shown but insisted that the defence procurement agency had undertaken a huge amount of work to expose any underlying problems on projects the latest findings follow a string of critical reports issued within the last months and according to our correspondent contain few new surprises turning around the defence procurement agency was a little like trying to turn around a super tanker it takes a very long time indeed he said our correspondent said it was the same projects including the joint strike fighter the nimrod and am aircraft and the type destroyer which were resonsible for the bulk of the cost overruns and delay but he added some projects such as the c heavy lift aircraft and successor identification friend or foe siff were showing good performances brown names march for budget chancellor gordon brown will deliver his budget to the house of commons on march the treasury has announced the budget likely to be the last before the general election will be at gmt on that wednesday just after prime ministers question time the annual event is when the chancellor outlines the governments taxation and broader economic predictions it is likely to set out much of the tax and spending battleground for the election widely expected on may next months budget will be mr browns eighth since labour came to power in if a may election is called there could be as little as days between the budget and the announcement of a date for the election a shortened finance bill would have to be rushed through parliament with allparty support to allow the government to continue collecting revenue the full finance bill with the budget measures in it would then be returned to the commons after the election if labour secures another term in office as mr brown announced the budget date in a short ministerial statement accountancy firm ernst young urged him to put politics aside and focus on the longterm requirements of the economy in the budgets that were given immediately before the last six elections taxes were cut by the incumbent chancellor and in many cases taxes were increased soon after the election result said aidan ocarroll eys uk head of tax asylum children to face returns the uk government is planning to return asylum seeker children without parents to albania the trial scheme which could start in weeks may be extended to apply to children from other countries childrens charities have reacted with alarm saying the policy amounts to forcible removal and may not guarantee the safety of those affected but the home office says it may be in the childrens best interests if it reunites them with their communities the pilot included in the governments fiveyear immigration plan aims to return unaccompanied asylumseeking children from albania who have failed in their asylum claims since at least unders have arrived in the uk to seek asylum without other family members these children automatically become the responsibility of social services up to now ministers have held back from final removal orders against unaccompanied children until after they are legally adults at at least a dozen albanianborn teenagers are thought to have been identified for return according to sources although there is no public confirmation of numbers those selected could either be returned to their families should they be traced or placed in the care of other albanian authorities separate negotiations to establish a family tracing and returns scheme are believed to be underway with another country under the children act public bodies have a duty to act in the best interest of a child in their care laura brownlees of save the children said there were grave concerns not least because of the welldocumented trafficking of children into crime and prostitution in albania if children are going to be returned then there should be proper assessments and decisions on a case by case basis she said we do not think there are structures in place to receive returning children in albania if these decisions are not in the best interests of the child then that is a forced removal because the child will not have any choice in the final decision in its fiveyear immigration plan announced on tuesday the government said it was addressing the difficult issue of returning unaccompanied asylum seeking children a spokesman for the home office said it was wholly wrong to suggest that the plan was to return children and leave them to rot we are developing a returns programme for unaccompanied asylumseeking children whose asylum and humanitarian protection claims have been refused said the spokesman we have been exploring how we can establish reception and longerterm care arrangements in countries of origin and believe that its possible to return children in a way that is in their best interests and is safe and sustainable we do not believe that it is right or in keeping with childrens legislation that children who can return should remain in the uk indefinitely separated from their families and communities the spokesman stressed the uk would abide by its international human rights obligations only those children who could be provided with a carefully planned reintegration package would be returned he said but andrew hogg spokesman for the medical foundation for the care of victims of torture said ministers had so far failed to reassure agencies from what is so far known we strongly oppose the scheme because the welfare and best interests of the child will not properly be taken into account said mr hogg in albania particularly there is no statutory child care or protection structure the medical foundation has many serious concerns including the assessment process for suitability for return the degrading of best interests of the child principles and of child welfare and the lack of safeguards in the chosen countries a spokesman for the albanian embassy in london said it was the first it had heard of a scheme but did not rule out that there had been an agreement between the two countries more to do on adult literacy the government will only hit its target for improving adult maths and literacy skills if courses are made more attractive a report says the national audit office praised ministers for reaching the benchmark of adults in england gaining basic qualifications by this year but a target of million more by needed creative ideas some million adults lack maths or english skill levels expected of schoolleavers according to the report more than half the qualifications achieved were by learners aged to these are defined as adults by the government for the purpose of compiling these figures normally adults are defined as being aged over the number of these people gaining qualifications was rising slowly auditor general sir john bourn said higher levels of literacy and numeracy will benefit england both socially and economically more people will have the opportunity to live richer lives in the government launched the get on scheme aimed at reducing illiteracy and innumeracy sir john said substantial progress had been made since adding that this was only the beginning the government and its partners would need to be creative and responsive some bn will be spent on implementing the programme by the report recommends gathering more details on the educational needs of areas so courses can be set to meet local demand existing adult learners could use their enthusiasm commitment and local knowledge to attract other people the department for education and skills could also use more personalised learning and work with voluntary groups councils and employers it should also assess adult learners progress at frequent intervals the report adds when the government announced it had reached its target earlier this month prime minister tony blair said it was only the start of the journey an estimated million adults have worse literacy than that expected of year olds while million have numeracy skills below this level this is thought to cost the uk economy hundreds of millions of pounds each year the qualifications achieved by those taking part in the governments scheme range up to gcse equivalents get ons participation target has been set at million by with an interim figure of million by education minister ivan lewis said we will continue to use creative ways of involving people with the lowest skill levels and the report shows that our efforts are gathering pace shadow education secretary tim collins said this is the third report in two days to highlight labours failure to ensure young people acquire the necessary levels of literacy and numeracy for their working life employers and business leaders have repeatedly voiced concern over the number of schoolleavers without these basic skills but all the government have offered is more talk liberal democrat education spokesman phil willis added far too little has been done to enable adult learners to fit learning into their busy lives tory backing for id cards the tories are to back controversial government plans to introduce id cards the shadow cabinet revealed its support ahead of next weeks commons vote on a bill to introduce compulsory id the decision follows a tough meeting where some senior tories argued vociferously against the move party sources told the bbc the bill which ministers claim will tackle crime terrorism and illegal immigration is expected to be opposed by the liberal democrats they have said the scheme is deeply flawed and a waste of money sources within the conservative party told the bbc michael howard has always been in favour of id cards and tried to introduce them when he was home secretary the party has been agnostic on the issue until now but had now decided to come off the fence the tory source said despite giving their backing to id cards the conservatives insisted they would hold ministers to account over the precise purpose of the scheme they said they would also press labour over whether objectives could be met and whether the home office would deliver them and they pledged to assess the cost effectiveness of id cards and whether peoples privacy would be properly protected it is important to remember that this bill will take a decade to come into full effect a spokesman said it will do nothing to solve the immediate problems of rising crime and uncontrolled immigration lib dem home affairs spokesman mark oaten said this has all the signs of michael howard overruling colleagues concerns over id cards the tories should have the courage to try and change public opinion not follow it the new chairman of the bar council guy mansfield qc warned there was a real risk that people on the margins of society would be driven into the hands of extremists what is going to happen to young asian men when there has been a bomb gone off somewhere they are going to be stopped if they havent id cards they are going to be detained labours eu propaganda a taxpayer subsidised propaganda exercise on the eu is being used to lull the british public into a false sense of security say the tories shadow foreign secretary michael ancram told mps a new white paper was part of trying to soften up opinion ahead of the referendum on the eu constitution his claims were denied by foreign secretary jack straw who accused the tories of running scared of debate eu cooperation would help get better uk immigration controls he argued mr straw used thursdays commons debate to launch the new white paper on the prospects for the eu in security stability and prosperity would be the key themes when the uk took over the chairmanship of the eu in july said mr straw africa and climate change would also feature highly he said the uk was trying to ensure future eu budgets were limited to of europes economic output and were spent where it adds most value mr straw promised to continue to ensure the uks budget rebate secured in by margaret thatcher was fully justified we like all other countries have a veto on any changes proposed in this area he said mr ancram condemned the document which the foreign office says has cost about to design print and deliver isnt the reason that the government is now involved in a taxpayer subsidised propaganda exercise to try to sell the new eu to the country in advance of the forthcoming referendum and general election he asked the tory spokesman also criticised the government for claiming the eu constitution would make europe easier to understand the government last week had to publish a commentary of pages to try and explain this easy and simple constitution to the british people he said who are they trying to kid the proposed question for the constitution referendum is should the united kingdom approve the treaty establishing a constitution for the european union the electoral commission on thursday said it was satisfied the question was easy to understand the government has suggested the referendum on the constitution could take place in spring with the tories set to campaign for a no vote mr ancram said ministers were prolonging uncertainty by putting the vote off until the latest date possible the foreign secretary hit back by saying tory attitudes to europe had helped keep the party out of power for more than a decade mr straw argued cooperation with european partners could bring a level playing field on immigration and asylum controls you are setting your face against all of these things he added for the liberal democrats sir menzies campbell said the uk should not ignore the need to reform the eu common agricultural policy change was particularly important for developing countries wanting access to markets he argued sir menzies was among those worried about plans backed by the uk to lift the arms embargo imposed on china after the tiananmen square massacre mr straw said no decisions had been taken chinese human rights had improved but not by enough uks useless quangos under fire the uk has quangos financed with billions of pounds of taxpayers cash many of which are useless or duplicate each others efforts a report claims essential guide to british quangos author dan lewis said at least of the appointed bodies had been set up since labour won power in he urged a limit on the number of quangos that could be set up by any individual government department tories and lib dems welcomed the report and called for a slimming down conservative deregulation spokesman john redwood said the research endorses our policy of destroying unwanted and unnecessary quangos and slimming down the rest a conservative government will axe quangos as part of its drive for more efficient and more accountable government lib dem spokesman ed davey meanwhile said instead of the bonfire of quangos new labour had promised there had been an explosion of them for over two decades under both tory and labour governments these unaccountable agencies have mushroomed liberal democrats would abolish many merge others and make any that remain properly accountable labour representatives were unavailable for comment the quango guide follows last years governmentcommissioned gershon report which recommended significant cuts in bureaucracy across the public sector mr lewis wants a public inquiry into regional development agencies which cost bn a year cash he says which appears to be almost entirely wasted as well as a departmental limit on quangos he also wants a statutory fiveyear limit on any such body with executive powers he also listed what he dubbed the nine most useless quangos they were the british potato council the milk development council the energy savings trust agricultural wages committees the wine standards board the westminster foundation for democracy the football licensing authority investors in people uk and the economic and social research council mr lewis branded the existence of the employee potato council set up in to research and promote overseas potato markets surprising he said the m spent annually on the energy savings trust which promotes renewable energy would be better spent on eight million boiler jackets for british homes and he argued it was absurd to charge farmers for agricultural wages committees which set working and wage standards in the industry when many were prepared to take advantage of immigrant labour prepared to work for an hour if a football team can afford to pay m for wayne rooney why should the taxpayer not all of whom like football be forced to fund the football licensing authority to the tune of over m a year mr lewis asked the report is published by the efficiency in government unit a joint effort by right of centre think tanks the economic research council and the centre for policy studies it says before a new public body is set up an assessment should be made whether its proposed role is already carried out by an existing charity or other private organisation howard backs stem cell research michael howard has backed stem cell research saying it is important people are not frightened of the future the controversial issue was a feature of the recent us presidential election where george bush opposed extending it but the tory leader argued there was a moral case for embracing science which could help victims of alzheimers parkinsons and motor neurone disease i believe we have a duty to offer hope to the millions of people who suffer devastating illnesses he said the use of embryonic stem cells in the uk is already allowed stem cells are master cells that have the ability to develop into any of the bodys tissue types scientists hope that by growing such cells in the laboratory they can programme them to form specific tissue such as kidney heart or even brain tissue mr howard acknowledged there were genuine concerns about stem cell research but he argued we mustnt be frightened of change or nostalgic about the past we must be optimistic about the future politicians must create the right framework so that the great potential of science can be harnessed for the benefit of mankind with the life expectancy of the average briton now around the mids society has a responsibility to enhance the quality of peoples lives as they grow older i know many people are concerned about stemcell research they are fearful of meddling with what they see as the stuff of souls i respect those concerns but i also believe we have a duty to offer hope to the millions of people who suffer devastating illnesses like parkinsons multiple sclerosis motor neurone disease alzheimers and as we saw in the papers today now possibly heart problems mr howard acknowledged there were no easy answers over such an issue but it was necessary to have the courage to do what we know to be morally right he added of course stem cells are still a recent discovery more research needs to be done but we must look at their potential in a responsible and grownup way the hopes of millions of people rest on what could be achieved former superman actor the late christopher reeve was an advocate for the research after he was paralysed in a horse riding accident mr howard made his remarks during a speech in westminster to the conservative national womens committee on ambitions and values tory leader quits legal position david mcletchie has resigned from his post as a partner in a legal firm following criticism over his dual role the scottish conservative leader had insisted that his legal work with tods murray did not influence the causes he supports but on friday he said i have tendered my resignation as a partner with immediate effect mr mcletchie had received advice from holyrood officials about what details he needed to declare labour said he had cleverly not asked about paid advocacy a tory spokesman totally refuted any wrongdoing mr mcletchie received advice from the clerk to the standards committee after concern over him signing a parliamentary motion questioning expansion plans for edinburgh airport the msp had been a partner for tods murray which has a client opposing the development mr mcletchie did not have a complaint made against him but when concerns were raised he sought guidance from the standards committee to clarify his position he was advised to exercise judgement to avoid the perception of a conflict and said he had done nothing wrong explaining his reason for quitting the post mr mcletchie said i have been greatly concerned by the recent publicity surrounding my association with tods murray however i have no wish to see a similar situation arise again to avoid any misconceptions in the future and be mindful of the good name of tods murray and the confidentiality to which its clients are entitled i have brought forward the date of my retirement from the firm which would otherwise have happened later this year i am proud to have been a part of tods murray for the last years and wish it well in the future labour msp christine may had said mr mcletchie was very clever to ask the clerk to consider his conduct in respect of section of the code he was almost bound to get the answer he wanted from this enquiry since he stands accused of breaching section the section on paid advocacy she said section of the members interest order legally obliges msps to declare registrable interests before taking part in related parliamentary proceedings where the interest would prejudice or give the appearance of prejudicing their ability to participate in a disinterested manner however msps code of conduct recognises a wider definition of parliamentary proceedings including a nonstatutory requirement to make a declaration in relation to written notices such as motions but a letter from holyroods chamber office chief ken hughes also made clear that mr mcletchie did not need to list any of the clients for whom he worked as a solicitor commenting on mr mcletchies decision to stand down a scottish labour party spokesman said this should mean mr mcletchie doesnt breach the paid advocacy rules in future however it doesnt change the fact that there should be a full investigation into whether he has done this in the past scottish national party holyrood leader nicola sturgeon accused mr mcletchie of failing to properly serve his constituents ms sturgeon said i think this whole episode has been very damaging for mr mcletchie and im sure he will be reflecting on it she added that she thought that the tories were an irrelevant party so she would not lose any sleep over it peter misselbrook executive partner of tods murray said mr mcletchie had been considering retirement later in the year he added david has decided that this announcement should be made now and we fully understand and appreciate his reasons for doing so vouchers to cut winter deaths pensioners are being promised energy savings by the liberal democrats as snow and cold temperatures continue the party says the plans could save the average pensioner every year and cut winter deaths the government gives for winter fuel to households with people over or where people are over the tories promise to keep the payments the lib dems would allow people to swap these winter fuel payments for discounts on home insulation shadow local government secretary ed davey said the current scheme has helped some older people but this new liberal democrat approach will go much further to end the scandal of tens of thousands of old people dying from the winter cold every year the vouchers are designed to let pensioners choose from a list of approved energy supplies who would compete for business by offering discounts on home insulation schemes the plan would boost energy conservation says the party and insulation could save every year for pensioner households so using the money more intelligently than at present new yob targets to be unveiled fifty new areas getting special help to fight antisocial behaviour in england and wales will be named on thursday ten areas have already had access to special prosecutors and local experts and the government is now expanding the crackdown to more towns and cities details of how many antisocial behaviour orders asbos were used in the last year are also being published labour sees nuisance behaviour as a key election issue but critics claim the record is at best patchy a year ago ministers launched their antisocial behaviour plan and thursdays figures offer a progress check they will say that in the past year more than antisocial behaviour orders were issued by the courts more than double the total used in the previous four years police have also closed crack houses and issued more than dispersal orders breaking up groups of youths in public places the new pilot areas to get special attention will also receive extra government funding exeter and cardiff are among cities who have voiced interest in being involved prime minister tony blair is also expected to announce new measures to strengthen the use of asbos and fixed penalty notices there are still concerns that some areas of the country are not using the powers properly he is expected to say that the new figures were heartening but he would not rest until similar action was taken in all areas of the country where it was needed we have not defeated this problem by any means but shown together what can be done he will say mr blair this week defended the shakeup of the licensing laws saying it was right to focus on troublemakers rather than treating everybody as a potential drunken nuisance ministers also boast of record police numbers and are speeding up plans to put in place community support officers csos but researchers from leeds university warned that csos could undermine traditional bonds between police officers and communities more work needed to be done on clarifying the role of different agencies and how they linked together before csos they argued in a the study critics of the government say it has announced more than initiatives to tackle nuisance behaviour when the real focus should be on good policing home office minister hazel blears also revealed this week that about a third of asbos were breached with some people jailed and others not kennedy calls for iraq exit plans tony blair should set out a proper exit strategy from iraq in the wake of next sundays elections in the country lib dem leader charles kennedy has said in a speech focusing on issues arising from the reelection of george w bush mr kennedy said iraq had become a crucible of militant terrorism he wants to see a phased withdrawal of uk troops as soon as the situation allows he said in london any exit strategy must augment and support the democratic process there are some who are of the opinion that the mere presence of british and american troops in iraq feeds the insurgency he said there is some truth in that especially after the initial mistakes that were made the heavyhandedness of operations like fallujah and the wellpublicised instances of abuse at the hands of coalition forces mr kennedy pointed out that the netherlands portugal and the czech republic which all have troops operating in the southern sector of iraq have announced their imminent withdrawal regardless of the situation on the ground he accused mr blairs government of being less than straightforward over its plans next week the prime minister should make a statement regarding the elections in iraq mr kennedy said during his city of london speech he should set out a proper exit strategy including the phased withdrawal of british troops as the security situation allows mr kennedy also argued that british troops deployed in iraq should be replaced with forces from other countries especially islamic countries mcconnell in drunk remark row scotlands first minister has told a group of high school pupils that it is okay to get drunk once in a while jack mcconnell was speaking to more than secondary pupils from schools in the highlands about the problems of binge drinking and drink promotions he has been criticised by the snp for encouraging young people to get drunk but the scottish executive has insisted mr mcconnell was speaking about adults and his comments were a recognition that people will get drunk the first ministers comments came in a question and answer session at glenurquhart high school in inverness attended by pupils from a number of secondary schools a highland councillor who was at the event has also defended mr mcconnell margaret davidson the independent member for the loch ness west said the first minister was speaking in a very general way and she was sure he was speaking about adults at the time when one pupil asked mr mcconnell how the executive proposed to tackle underage drinking began his response with the quip im sure theres no underage drinking in the highlands he went on to speak about the evils of binge drinking and railed against irresponsible drinks promotions he said i hope im not going to be seen as preaching to anybody here but the really serious problem at the moment is binge drinking and the impact it has on peoples health and their ability to control whats happening round about them mr mcconnell said he regularly saw reports on the effects of binge drinking sprees which ended in assaults or even rapes and on the health consequences of binge drinking the one thing we are going to do something really serious about is binge drinking and irresponsible drinks promotions that can help lead to that he said far too many pub chains in particular are selling far too much booze far too cheaply and encouraging people to drink it far too quickly we are go to clamp down on that and make those promotions illegal in the hope that people can enjoy a drink sensibly over the course of an evening he added by all means get drunk once in a while but do not get into a situation where people are being encouraged to get completely incapable just to save some money and drink more quickly snp holyrood leader nicola sturgeon said this is an incredible gaffe by jack mcconnell we all know that underage drinking is an issue in scotland but it is quite staggering that any politician particularly the first minister should encourage young people to get drunk the first minister should withdraw these remarks immediately but an executive spokeswoman insisted mr mcconnell had made the remark with adults not youngsters in mind he was talking in the context of adults binge drinking and irresponsible drinks promotions which are for the overs she said it was just a recognition that people will get drunk but that binge drinking and drinks promotions that encourage it are not acceptable brown hits back in blair rift row gordon brown has criticised a union leader who said conflict between himself and tony blair was harming the workings of government jonathan baume of the top civil servants union spoke of competing agendas between mr brown and mr blair but the chancellor said mr baume was never at meetings between himself and the prime minister so could not judge he said the union leader was trying to block civil service reform which threatened his members jobs it suited the purpose of mr baumes union the first division association to suggest there were two agendas battling against each other because the union was trying to resist the planned reforms mr brown told bbc radio s today programme under the plans unveiled in the gershon report some civil servants jobs will be axed or changed and the savings ploughed back into frontline services mr brown said to be honest i dont think you can rely on his mr baumes judgement on this matter when it comes to the decisions that the government are making mr blair and i are making exactly the same decisions on civil service reforms we are determined to go on with the gershon reforms he also said that as mr baume was never present at meetings between himself and the prime minister he was not in a position to judge on wednesday ahead of the chancellors prebudget report mr baume told bbc news there were sometimes conflicting and competing agendas for government between number and the treasury what the chancellor wanted was not by any means what alan milburn and the prime minister want to see mr baume said government departments get their money from the treasury on the basis of public service agreements they sign up to but at the same time the prime minister also has an agenda and thats not necessarily the same as the treasurys and the prime minister is of course a very powerful figure in any government he also sends instructions and messages and directions to departments about how he would like each secretary of state and each department to implement a policy agenda the problem is that on many occasions these two dont add up and individual cabinet ministers as well as departments have to make sense of this battle number said ministers were interested in governing and not a soap opera about mr blair and mr brown tory shadow chancellor oliver letwin said the battle royal that the top civil servants are now reporting on between the chancellor and tony blair is preventing them both from getting on with the business of getting taxpayers value for money tories would cut number of mps the conservative party would cut the number of mps by about onefifth if they were elected tory leader michael howard has said the plan forms part of the partys smaller government bill to be unveiled later this week mr howard told the sunday times the party would also reduce the number of government special advisers and he said a referendum would be held in wales to decide whether or not to scrap the welsh assembly the changes would all take place within five years of the conservatives winning a general election mr howard told the paper the precise number of mps to go would depend on the result of the welsh referendum but it would probably mean a reduction of around from the current total of if wales decided to keep its assembly it would stand to lose more mps mr howard said as both parties planned to cut the number of civil servants at whitehall labour by more than and the tories by almost they should accept a similar drop in their own numbers it is all very well saying government departments should be reduced but what about ministers parliament and special advisers he said shadow leader of the commons oliver heald said this will be part of our aim to reduce unnecessary and costly interference in peoples lives by reducing the size and role of the state mr howard said the plan would also even out the great unfairness of there being proportionately more scottish and welsh mps at westminster than those from england the average size of an english constituency was people mr howard said in northern ireland it was just over in wales just over and in scotland the number of welsh mps would be set at an amount that was consistent and fair in terms of representation with the rest of the united kingdom if the assembly was scrapped mr howard said the changes should be carried out quickly and could even be implemented by the election after next you have got to have a big bang we dont want this like the house of lords reform getting to one stage and then not having the next stage uk plan to deport terror suspects deals are being sought to allow the uk to deport terror suspects to their home countries without risk of them being tortured or sentenced to death home secretary charles clarke told the times he hoped agreement with several countries could be reached the move follows a law lords judgement that the detention of men at belmarsh prison london and woodhill milton keynes was unlawful the affected by the ruling are from algeria tunisia egypt and jordan the government was told that using antiterror legislation brought in after september to hold the men indefinitely without charge broke human rights laws mr clarke told the times i think we should be prosecuting much more energetically our ability to deport the individuals concerned to the countries from which they come he said it was a route that was being pursued in collaboration with foreign secretary jack straw in a very positive way mr clarke said that he was seeking memorandums of understanding between overseas governments and britain to ensure suspects would not be subjected to the death penalty on their return however he added i do not think the solution to the law lords judgement for this government is in deportations but they will help there are other strands that we have to do but the liberal democrats shadow home secretary mark oaten accused mr clarke of avoiding the main issue with the belmarsh detainees the critical issue that the home secretary is dodging at this stage is to deal with the very principle to deal with how we tackle this problem in the future he told bbc news and i do want him to grasp those issues and that means looking at how we can actually secure convictions in this country allowing for example intercept communications telephone tapping to be included mr oaten said deportation may tackle this initial problem but i want to see a wider debate urgently about how we can actually get trials and convictions in this country unless we get that the liberal democrats will vote against this measure when it comes for renewal in march the bbcs home affairs correspondent daniel sandford said it appeared mr clarke was putting more emphasis on the possibility of deportation than his predecessor david blunkett but he said reaching an understanding with some of the detainees home countries could be difficult some of these people are accused of very very serious crimes in their home countries so its not an easy agreement to get and i think for some of these suspects it wont be the solution daniel sandford said ministers may try to put forward other solutions such as allowing more secret evidence to be put into normal criminal trials or developing a more secret trials process in the next few weeks the government may try and deport some of them and then those that are left see if they can work out some way of putting them on trial he said ministers deny care sums wrong ministers have insisted they are committed to free personal care for the elderly despite research suggesting the cost of the policy was underestimated a report by the fraser of allander institute says the decision to push ahead with the flagship policy was based on flawed research deputy health minister rhona brankin has pledged to study the research snp holyrood leader nicola sturgeon said the public needed reassurance that the care programme was secure the rise in costs stems from a series of mistakes in the research used by the care development group of scottish executive experts who prepared the original costings according to findings published in the quarterly economic commentary of strathclyde universitys fraser of allander institute dubious assumptions about improving health expectancy could drive the cost of the policy up by another m by the report warned it was carried out by husband and wife economist team jim and margaret cuthbert but ms brankin told bbc radio scotland we dont think we got our sums wrong obviously we will examine the findings of this new report along with figures from our own research that we have already commissioned we will look in great detail at any contribution to this because we need to be sure we can provide free personal care and nursing care for our older people into the future and we are absolutely committed to doing that but the scottish national party called on ministers to reassure people that enough funding is in place to support the free personal care policy ms sturgeon said that while she had no reason to doubt the executives support for the policy there were questions which needed to be answered and if necessary sums redone she said serious concerns have been raised and there are questions which need to be answered by the scottish executive we need to know that the money is there not just for this year or next year but into the future so that older people and those who are looking forward to older age can rest assured that their personal care needs will be met blair stresses prosperity goals tony blair says his partys next manifesto will be unremittingly new labour and aimed at producing personal prosperity for all the prime minister is trying to draw a line under speculation over the state of his relationship with gordon brown with the speech in chatham kent he is saying that prosperity means both individual wealth and ensuring radically improved public services he is also claiming labour is more ideologically united than ever mr brown is currently touring africa after a week of facing questions about reports of his splits with downing street with the election widely predicted for may angry labour mps this week warned mr blair and mr brown about the dangers of disunity now mr blair is trying to put the focus on the substance of labours platform for a third term in government labour made low inflation unemployment and mortgage rates the centrepiece of a new poster campaign this week and on thursday mr blair is saying i want to talk about the central purpose ofnew labour which is to increase personal prosperity and wellbeing not justfor a few but for all by prosperity i mean both the income and wealth of individuals and theirfamilies and the opportunity and security available to them through radicallyimproved public services and a reformed welfare state the tories are trying to capitalise on the apparent feud at the top of government on wednesday they unveiled a poster which pictured the prime minister and mr brown under the words how can they fight crime when they are fighting each other michael howard and frontbencher john redwood on thursday launched new plans to abolish hundreds of quangos they say government is spending too much and lower taxes are needed to make britain more competitive the liberal democrats have also claimed infighting its obstructing good government the latest speculation about relations between new labours two most powerful figures came after the publication of a new book browns britain by robert preston in it he alleges that mr blair told mr brown in he would step down as prime minister before the coming general election the book claims the premier went back on his pledge after support from cabinet allies and suspicion that mr brown was manoeuvring against him mr pestons book claimed that mr brown told mr blair there is nothing you could ever say to me now that i could ever believe on wednesday mr blair directly denied mr brown made that quote and before he left for africa on tuesday the chancellor told reporters of course i trust the prime minister guantanamo man suing government a british terror suspect held in guantanamo bay for months plans to sue the government it is reported martin mubanga claimed in the observer that an mi officer played a key role in consigning him to the us camp in cuba following his arrest in zambia mr mubanga from wembley london said he was brutally interrogated and daubed with urine at the camp the home secretary said he would not be launching an investigation and that the media reports were not well informed mr mubanga who has dual british and zambian nationality was one of four britons who were released from the us camp in january he said he was sent there after being interrogated by a british man who said he was from mi shortly after his arrest in zambia in march mr mubanga said he had been in afghanistan and pakistan to study islam but he said he was unable to return to the uk because he had lost his british passport and was travelling on his zambian passport instead mr mubanga said the mi agent told him the passport had been found in a cave in afghanistan along with documents listing jewish groups in new york and suggested he had been on an alqaeda reconnaissance mission mr mubanga said the man and an american female defence official tried to recruit him as an agent but he refused and within three weeks was told he would be sent to guantanamo bay his lawyer louise christian said we are hoping to issue proceedings for the misfeasance of officials who colluded with the americans in effectively kidnapping him and taking him to guantanamo and menzies campbell the liberal democrats foreign affairs spokesman said it was vital to establish whether ministers approved mr mubangas transfer to guantanamo but a foreign office spokesman said he could not comment on the activities of british intelligence or security agencies and home secretary charles clarke told bbc ones breakfast with frost im not organising a specific investigation into it mr mubanga is the first of the four detainees freed last month to give a media interview he told the observer his worst moment was when he was told he would be released last march only to be confined and told he would be there for many more years he claimed he was stripped of his clothes and mattress and forced to remain in an empty metal box naked except for boxer shorts and he said an interrogator used a mop to daub him with his own urine while he was chained hand and foot mr mubanga who insists he does not feel bitter said ive lost three years of my life because i was a muslim he added the authorities wanted to break me but they strengthened me theyve made me what i am even if im not quite sure yet who that person is the us government denied the claims saying it condemned and prohibited torture in a statement it said the department of defense has no doubt that mr mubanga was properly detained as an enemy combatant under the laws of war he was detained to prevent him from fighting against the us and our allies in the war on terror but fair trials abroad director stephen jakobi said there were similarities between mr mubangas account and those of other guantanamo detainees he said the pattern is the same the real problem is the concentration camp conditions in guantanamo is charles clarke really pretending this is all made up mr mubanga and the three other freed british detainees were released without charge by uk police on their return from cuba council tax rise reasonable welsh councils should set their taxes at reasonable levels after being given an average funding increase of says the assembly government finance minister sue essex said it was a good deal for local government the bn settlement includes the full m from the uk treasury announced by chancellor gordon brown but opposition parties said rebanding of council taxes would mean steep rises in addition m will come from the business support grant a scheme which enables local authorities to keep part of business rates she said where spending rises were kept to around she was confident that councils will be able to set council taxes at reasonable levels the welsh local government association wlga had said on the eve of the announcement said that significant cuts to services may still be unavoidable after the announcement wlga finance spokesman bob wellington of torfaen said it was vital that rises were minimsed a limited amount of money has come available but this is not the answer to our problems said mr wellington it is vital that we start now to plan for future years and accept that resources will continue to reduce while pressures on services increase on monday a delegation of north wales councils visited ms essex to lobby for increased funds ms essex said i have listened to the views of local government and council tax payers and recognise the funding pressures and the concerns they have about council tax rises i have met a large number of local authorities in recent weeks and i am aware of the pressures on them to provide local services and keep down the level of council tax particularly for those people to are moving up a band due to the revaluation of domestic properties she said council taxes could be kept at reasonable levels even for those people who have moved up a band the settlement includes a rise in the grant to help councils with the most deprived communities and a rise in capital expenditure support ms essex said this is a good deal for local government which will allow the wellmanaged councils of wales to develop their services and charge reasonable levels of council tax it is now a matter for council leaders to manage their budgets at a local level plaid cymrus local government spokesman dai lloyd called the announcement hugely disappointing he said wales and its local authorities have been short changed yet again this is not whinging as the labour assembly government so often claims it is anger this will mean either a massive hike in council tax massive cuts in services provided by councils or both mike german leader of the liberal democrats in the assembly claimed that one in three homes were still likely to face council tax rises due to rebanding mr german said i know from my discussions with welsh liberal democrat council leaders that they are doing their utmost to keep council tax to a minimum but the random redistribution effect of rebandingwill create a great deal of difficulty conservative local government spokesman glyn davies said that for the minister to claim that the majority of council tax payers in wales should see very little change is taking spin to the very verge of deception he added around a third of welsh households have been revalued upwards by at least one band and inevitably face increases into double figures blunkett row should end blair prime minister tony blair said it was time to draw a line under the controversy surrounding david blunkett the tories and the lib dems have called for a second inquiry into the fasttracking of a visa application for mr blunketts exlovers nanny sir alan budd found a chain of events linked mr blunkett to leoncia casalmes indefinite leave to remain application at the end of his middle east trip mr blair said he still admired mr blunkett and thought his integrity was intact on tuesday sir alan said the application for leave to remain in the uk made by kimberly quinns nanny was processed in days days faster than the average but he could not find evidence to show whether mr blunketts intervention was intended to give special help for his then lovers nanny or if he was raising the case as an example of poor departmental performance in his first comments since sir alans announcement mr blair told bbc news he had not yet read the report in detail but told bbc news as far as im concerned we have drawn a line under that asked if mr blunkett could return to frontline politics at some point he replied i have made my admiration for david very clear and it remains hes been a tremendous colleague hes done a great job for us first as home secretary then as education secretary the future is something we will have to approach in the future the prime minister shrugged off claims from conservative leader michael howard that he led a grubby government he said mr blunketts integrity remained intact he was the person first of all who asked for this inquiry to be set up he accepted that what he originally thought had happened had not happened he said but i think sir alan budd also accepted there wasnt some conspiracy or coverup and i just think a line should be drawn under now and we should move on earlier mr howard said there does need to be another inquiry a judgeled inquiry there were so many questions that werent answered there was deceit at the heart of government which was not limited to the visa affair he argued lib dem home affairs spokesman mark oaten also said there was a strong case for a judgeled judicial review he said next time it happens it may not be about a nanny and their visa it may be about something even more important than that mr blunkett quit as home secretary last week after being told in advance of sir alans findings in a statement the exhome secretary said he accepted the inquirys findings he said he had told the truth throughout and had raised the nanny case as an example of unacceptable backlogs in the system minimum rate for foster parents foster carers are to be guaranteed a minimum allowance to help cover their costs the government has announced payment levels vary from area to area with some carers getting just a week for clothes food and other costs minister for children young people and families margaret hodge said new plans will ensure fosterers allowances would be as fair as possible however local authorities which set and pay the allowances are concerned about how the extra cash will be found about children live with foster families in the uk and carers have said they need more money to make ends meet ms hodge said foster carers must not be out of pocket when meeting the costs of caring for a looked after child a crucial role in society we need to make sure that arrangements for paying foster carers are as fair and transparent as possible our proposal for a national minimum rate shows we are serious about creating a better deal for foster carers and about encouraging more people to come forward and consider fostering as a worthwhile and rewarding opportunity the government is seeking to amend the children bill which passes through the commons next week to establish a national minimum payment fostering network executive director robert tapsfield criticised the existing system there is just no logic to a system which values children differently depending on where they live and with a shortage of over foster carers in england its not a sustainable situation to expect carers to fund foster care from their own pockets the charity recommends a weekly payment of for looking after a baby in a survey it discovered that rates paid by neighbouring authorities could vary by as much as per week the association of directors of social services adss said it agreed in principle with the governments plans tony hunter the organisations president said there are many devils and lots of details hidden within the governments proposals but adss fully supports proper remuneration for valued foster carers and looks forward to working with ministers local government and the fostering organisations themselves in order to make sure a sensible and practicable policy emerges royal couple watch nations mood prince charles and camilla parker bowles are awaiting the nations reaction after announcing they are to be married on april mrs parker bowles will take the title hrh duchess of cornwall after a civil ceremony to be held at windsor castle a daily telegraph poll of people suggests twothirds of britons support the couples decision to marry but only think mrs parker bowles should become princess consort as planned after charles becomes king some believe she should have no title while think she should become queen the poll also found that the majority of britons would prefer the monarchy to miss a generation with the queen handing the throne to her grandson prince william on her death or abdication on thursday night prince charles and mrs parker bowles hosted a dinner at windsor castle their first public appearance since announcing their engagement mrs parker bowles said the prince went down on one knee to propose and added im just coming down to earth she displayed her diamond engagement ring a royal family heirloom to reporters charles said he and his wifetobe were absolutely delighted their marriage will end years of speculation on a relationship which dates back to the queen and duke of edinburgh said the news had made them very happy princes william and harry said they are very happy and wish the couple all the luck in the future the wedding will be a civil ceremony followed by a service of prayer and dedication in st georges chapel at which the archbishop of canterbury dr rowan williams will preside the marriage is likely to be a sensitive issue because mrs parker bowles is divorced and her former husband is still alive if he became king charles would be the supreme governor of the church of england and some anglicans remain opposed to the remarriage of divorcees his divorce from diana and the disappointment the country felt over how diana had been treated opened up a sense of disillusionment with prince charles said ros coward who wrote the authorised biography of diana princess of wales the archbishop of canterbury said i am pleased that prince charles and mrs camilla parker bowles have decided to take this important step tony blair said he was delighted for the couple and offered his congratulations as did conservative leader michael howard and liberal democrat leader charles kennedy australias prime minister john howard also offered his congratulations adding that their decision to marry was a sensible and a good thing mrs parker bowles has joined the prince at numerous engagements in recent years mostly at evening events for the princes trust clarence house staff were at pains to point out that she attended these events in a private capacity muslim police stops more likely uk muslims should accept that people of islamic appearance are more likely to be stopped and searched by police a home office minister has said hazel blears said innocent muslims would be targeted because of the search for islamic extremists qualifications for religious leaders to enter the uk could also be made tougher she told a commons inquiry her comments have been described as irresponsible and outrageous by the islamic human rights commission ihrc the threat is most likely to come from those people associated with an extreme form of islam or who are falsely hiding behind islam the salford mp told the commons home affairs committee it means that some of our counterterrorism powers will be disproportionately experienced by the muslim community it was a reality that should be recognised she said if a threat is from a particular place then our action is going to be targeted at that area she added on ministers of religions such as imams she said faith groups would be asked what other qualifications and skills such as civic knowledge and ability to engage the community should be demanded last year ministers introduced a requirement that ministers should speak english to a certain level ihrc chairman massoud shadjareh accused ms blears of playing an islamophobia card in the runup to a general election she is demonising and alienating our community he said it is a legitimisation for a backlash and for racists to have an onslaught on our community this sort of comment is just music to the ears of racists later the prime ministers official spokesman urged people to put ms blears comments into context the minister had been saying she understood there was a perception that stop and search was aimed at one community but that was not what was happening the spokesman said what is happening is that those powers are aimed at those who are suspected of carrying out or planning certain activity who happen to come from one community it is not aimed at a particular community it is not police policy to aim these powers at a particular community he added statistics showed that of the people found guilty of terrorist acts in the uk since the september attacks only four of the whose ethnic backgrounds were known were muslim he added figures published last week showed that people from ethnic minorities were increasingly likely to be targeted by police stop and search tactics figures showed that for asians were times more likely to be stopped and searched compared with times more likely in the previous year separate figures on police searches in england and wales carried out under the terrorism act showed that ethnic minorities were more likely to be targeted muslim groups have repeatedly claimed that their communities are being victimised under terror laws in searches under the laws were on asian people even though they make up of the population last july the police were accused of islamophobia by muslim groups after stop and search figures showed the numbers of asians targeted had risen by since the introduction of antiterror laws howard attacks cost of asylum michael howard has launched an attack on the cost of britains chaotic asylum system under tony blair the tory leader said english local authorities have spent more than bn or per household on asylum since labour won power in mr howard is expected to tell activists in kent that voters tolerance and desire to help others are being abused other parties and refugee agencies have already attacked tory plans for annual limits on numbers mr howard said britain should take its fair share of the worlds genuine refugees the anniversary of the liberation of auschwitz where my grandmother was murdered along with over a million others has reminded all of us that we have a moral responsibility to those fleeing persecution he was due to say but if we are to fulfil responsibility we have to get a grip of the system fair play matters people want a government that upholds the rules not one that turns a blind eye when they are bent and abused he said and lets be clear our asylum system is being abused and with it britains generosity earlier this week mr howard said his partys plans to cut immigration were not racist arguing they would make the asylum system fairer for genuine refugees if elected his party would institute an annual limit on asylum and all claims would be processed overseas that prompted some charities to say the plans would put refugees lives at risk if they were turned away once quotas were filled if we have a moral responsibility towards people fleeing persecution then these policies will not provide a safe haven said hannah ward of the refugee council if people turn up in the uk asking for help they will be turned away michael howards policy effectively means there is no safe haven in the uk when it comes to costs then perhaps we should start with how decisions are made on asylum seekers so many of them are shown to be wrong one in five decisions that are appealed are successfully overturned rising to half for some nationalities we need good quality decisionmaking on asylum applications because it is delays in the system which cost so much tony blair said labour would set out workable plans for tackling immigration abuse in the next few weeks and attacked the tory plans by cutting the number of frontline immigration staff at our borders they will actually make the problem worse said mr blair liberal democrat chairman matthew taylor said there needed to be a quick fair and firm asylum system but he said it was absolutely disgusting to propose a system which could turn away genuine refugees the conservatives say there is little risk of this happening as demand for asylum will be considered when quotas are set on monday mr howard said its not racist as some people to claim to talk about controlling immigration far from it brown outlines third term vision gordon brown has outlined what he thinks should be the key themes of new labours next general election bid he said ensuring every child in britain had the best start in life could be a legacy to match the nhss creation the chancellor has previously planned the partys election strategy but this time the role will be filled by alan milburn a key ally of tony blair the premier insisted mr brown will have a key role in labours campaign and praised his handling of the economy writing in the guardian newspaper mr brown outlined his view of the direction new labour should be taking as our manifesto and our programme for the coming decade should make clear labours ambition is not simply tackling idleness but delivering full employment not just attacking ignorance disease and squalor but promoting lifelong education good health and sustainable communities bbc political editor andrew marr said that mr browns article was a warning shot to mr blair not to try and cut him out of the manifesto writing process it was as always coded and careful but entirely deliberate was mr marrs assessment the prime minister was asked about mr browns article and about his election role when he appeared on bbc radio s today programme mr blair said a decision had yet to be taken over how the election would be run but the chancellors role would be central mr blair argued that under new labour the country had changed for the better and that was in part because of mr browns management of the economy and he pledged childcare would be a centrepiece of labours manifesto he also predicted the next general election will be a tough tough fight for new labour but the prime minister insisted he did not know what date the poll would take place despite speculation about may mr blair said he was taking nothing for granted ahead of the vote warning that the tory strategy was to win power via the back door by hinting they were aiming to cut labours majority instead of hoping for an outright win super union merger plan touted two of britains big trade unions could merge to form a super union of two million members the move by amicus and the transport and general workers union tgwu would be a seen as a bid to carry more weight with ministers and employers amicus has million members and the tgwu has any merger would have to be approved by the unions executives and their membership it is understood meetings will be held on wednesday about the proposal along with the gmb and unison the tgwu and amicus worked closely together in the last year to hammer out a point deal with labours leadership over equality at work holidays and pensions the warwick agreement both unions are remaining tightlipped about the merger rumours but one insider pointed out to the bbc news website that nobody is denying suggestions a merger could be on the agenda when the two unions executives hold their meetings on wednesday amicuss executive was due to meet in any case although the tgwu is holding specially scheduled talks uk firms embracing ecommerce uk firms are embracing internet trading opportunities as never before ecommerce minister mike obrien says a governmentcommissioned study ranked the uk third in its world index of use of information and communication technology ict the report suggests of uk firms are now using broadband and that of micro businesses are trading online mr obrien said uk businesses were sprinting forward in ict use but that there were more challenges ahead the report carried out independently by consultants booz allen hamilton and hi europe placed the uk third behind sweden and ireland for business use of ict it showed british business brought greater maturity to their ict use by using broadband in increased numbers bringing ict into their business plans and using new technologies such as voice activated programmes and desktop video conferences mr obrien said the increase in the proportion of business connected by broadband shows that uk companies are embracing the opportunities that ict can bring it is particularly encouraging to see that small businesses are beginning to narrow the digital divide that appeared to have opened up in recent years the government would play its part in cultivating an environment where information and communication technologies can flourish mr obrien said the clear message the report sends is that effective use of ict can bring real improvements in business performance for all business however we are not at the finishing line yet and many challenges remain if the uk is to reach its aim of becoming a worldleading eeconomy he added the international benchmarking study was based on telephone interviews with businesses of which more than were uk businesses it is the eighth in a series of examining the adoption and deployment of ict in the worlds most industrialised nations uk heading wrong way howard tony blair has had the chance to tackle the problems facing britain and has failed michael howard has said britain is heading in the wrong direction the conservative leader said in his new year message mr blairs government was a bossy interfering government that takes decisions that should be made by individuals he added but labours campaign spokesman fraser kemp responded britain is working dont let the tories wreck it again mr howard also paid tribute to the nations character for its generous response to the asian quake disaster the catastrophe was overshadowing the hopes for the future at this usually positive time of the year mr howard said we watched the scenes of destruction with a sense of disbelief the scale the speed the ferocity of what happened on boxing day is difficult to grasp yet britains response has shone a light on our nations character the last week has shown that the warm caring heart of britain beats as strong as ever he went on to reflect on the values that most britons hold dear looking ahead to the coming general election he pledged to turn these beliefs into reality and set out the choices he says are facing britain how much tax do people want to pay who will give taxpayers value for money the clean hospitals and good disciplined schools they want who can be trusted to get a grip on the disorder on our streets and the chaos in our immigration system mr blair has failed to tackle these problems he claimed saying he has the wrong solution to them the result is big government and higher taxes eroding incentives undermining enterprise and denying people choice worst of all it is a government that has wasted peoples money and failed to tackle the problems families face today the tories he said can cut crime and improve public services without asking people to pay more taxes we can have progress without losing what makes britain great its tolerance the respect for the rule of law the ability of everyone to fulfil their potential we simply need to change direction the election will give britain the chance to change this is the record mr blair will have to defend in the coming months he said urging voters to hold him to account but labour spokesman mr kemp said it would be more appropriate for this message to come out on april not january let us never forget that when michael howard was in government britain suffered mass unemployment interest rates record home repossessions and the introduction of the poll tax with labour britain is working rather than alluding to false promises michael howard should be starting with an apology to the british people for the misery that the government of which he was a member inflicted upon the country kilroy launches veritas party exbbc chat show host and east midlands mep robert kilroysilk has said he wants to change the face of british politics as he launched his new party mr kilroysilk who recently quit the uk independence partysaid our country was being stolen from us by mass immigration he told a london news conference that veritas latin for truth would avoid the old parties lies and spin ukip leader roger knapman says he was glad to see the back of mr kilroysilk mr kilroysilk promised a firm but fair policy on immigration and said they hoped to contest most seats at the forthcoming general election he said veritas would also announce detailed policies on crime tax pensions health and defence over the next few weeks and he announced the party would be holding a leadership election on thursday he is due to announce which constituency he will run in at the next general election that will come amid speculation he has his sights set on defence secretary geoff hoons ashfield seat he was joined in the new venture by one of ukips two london assembly members damien hockney who is now veritas deputy leader ukips chairman petrina holdsworth has said the group will just be a parody of the party the men have left mr kilroysilk announced his decision to quit ukip at a public meeting in hinckley leicestershire last week it came after months of tension as he vied unsuccessfully for the leadership of that party he said he was ashamed to be a member of a ukip whose leadership had gone awol after the great opportunity offered by its third place at last junes european elections while ukip has turned its back on the british people i shall not he said i will be standing at the next general election i shall be leading a vigorous campaign for the causes i believe in and unlike the old parties we shall be honest open and straight mr hockney also left ukip saying mr kilroysilk would deliver better as the leader of a eurosceptic party a spokesman for ukip called on mr hockney to quit the london assembly the party asserts that mr hockney has a moral obligation if not a legal one to stand down its leader roger knapman has said he is glad to see the back of mr kilroysilk he has remarkable ability to influence people but sadly after the european election it became clear that he was more interested in the robert kilroysilk party than the uk independence party so it was nice knowing him now goodbye he said ukip officials also argue mr kilroysilk has not been straightforward in attacking the party he once wanted to lead this is just what the europhiles pray for as the main eurosceptic party ukip should try to resolve its differences with kilroy to show a united front and give the uk public a serious political voice against europe having multiple parties with the same view point just splits the vote further thank goodness that kilroysilk has gone now ukip at least has a chance in the election it is very sad to see the cause of britain regaining its proper relationship with europe damaged by this split within ukip robert kilroysilk could have a lot to offer instead we have a split party and a damaged cause under the present electoral system people must work together and small parties have no hope of representation last summer ukip achieved a major advance partly and only partly due to kilroysilk it is a great shame this has been dissipated in infighting ukip has a wide platform of policies not just withdrawal from the eu this kilroysilk conveniently ignores in the comments surrounding the launch of his own party neither the english democrats nor the new party were interested in letting him join them and take over their leadership speaks volumes veritas is the beginning of the end for kilroysilk if he believes in truth and democracy then he and the two assembly members should resign and force a byelections to stand on their own platform rather than this backdoor approach to politics of being elected for one party then defecting to another so ukip was good enough for him to lead not good enough for him to follow interesting that a party committed to plain speaking should have a latin name every opinion poll points to an overwhelming antieurope feeling in this country kilroysilk could be on the verge of something huge if he can broaden his appeal beyond this one issue he is an extremely able communicator with years of political experience we wants quality schools top hospitals clean and efficient public transport punishments that fit the crime limited asylum a purge on bureaucracy and less taxes it needs courage and honesty two qualities sadly lacking in our politicians kilroysilk may just have those very qualities recruit the right colleagues robert and your time may have come well if you cannot get enough limelight being an ordinary mp then go out and start up your own party its all flash and no real policy here lets hope this is the start of both ukip and kilroysilk slipping into obscurity veritas the name will doom it but perhaps i am wrong for surely all modern schoolchildren will understand it since they do still learn latin in the classroom do they not the whole essence of what rks represents is euroscepticism so explain to me how the tootwee label of veritas symbolises that csa could close says minister ministers would not rule out scrapping the child support agency if it failed to improve work and pensions secretary alan johnson has warned but he said replacing the controversial csa would be the nuclear option a report by the commons work and pensions committee called for the agency to be wound up unless it improved its service within weeks chairman sir archy kirkwood said if the agency cannot be rescued then it must be replaced the committee reached its conclusions after it found that nearly cases have yet to be processed it warned that it could be five years before the csa was fit for purpose describing it as a failing organisation and in crisis with parents facing payment delays and inaccurate maintenance calculations the report urged the csa to draw up contingency plans including the abandonment option to be presented to parliament by easter in case the cs computer system could not be made to work and responding to calls for the agency to be scrapped mr johnson told bbc radio s today programme i certainly wouldnt rule out the nuclear option of moving to a completely new system but i think the select committee would agree with me we would only do that when we were absolutely convinced that this system just isnt going to work the mps launched their inquiry into the csas performance after it became clear that despite the introduction of a simpler system of calculating maintenance payments for new cases in a backlog of claims was building up the mps found the m system from american it giant eds was nowhere near being fully functional and the number of dissatisfied disenchanted and angry customers continues to escalate faced with the committees criticism the government has suspended its plan to cut the agencys staff by the csa has been surrounded in controversy since its introduction in to assess and enforce child support payments by absent parents it is currently chasing outstanding payments of more than m while a further m has been designated as unrecoverable michelle a mother of twins said she had not received a penny of the a week she should be receiving from her expartner and had faced an ongoing battle with the csa her forms have twice been lost in the post she said i dont receive correspondence i dont receive phone calls i have to chase them all the time she said theresa may tory shadow work and pensions secretary said we have got to find a way thats going to ensure those payments get through to the people who are due them the agencys former chief executive doug smith quit last autumn claiming he was seriously disappointed with its performance the committee said the national audit office should investigate why the eds system had gone so badly wrong it blamed the agencys senior management for a multitude of problems within the agency including for an apparent lack of training of frontline staff boothroyd calls for lords speaker betty boothroyd has said the house of lords needs its own speaker and that peers should lead the way on reforming the upper chamber baroness boothroyd who was the first woman to be commons speaker said she believed tony blair initiated reforms without a clear outcome in mind now we have to take care of it ourselves and make the best of it she told the bbcs breakfast with frost in labour removed all but of the lords hereditary peers that was billed as the first stage of reform of the institution the lord chancellor hinted further reforms could be unveiled in the next labour manifesto i think we need to look very carefully at the relationship between the lords and the commons lord falconer told bbcs breakfast with frost how it interacts with the commons is a very very important issue we need to address the issue in the manifesto but you will have to wait for when the manifesto comes the lord chancellor currently has the role of house of lords speaker he is also head of the judiciary and a member of the cabinet as constitutional affairs secretary lady boothroyd said she believed it was unacceptable for the lord chancellor to have the role of speaker i would really like to see a speaker of the house of lords she said i dont go for the idea of somebody a lord chancellor who is head of the judiciary a senior cabinet minister and speaker of the lords i want somebody there who is going to look after that house and do a job there bid to cut court witness stress new targets to reduce the stress to victims and witnesses giving evidence in courts in england and wales have been announced by the lord chancellor lord falconer wants all crown courts and of magistrates courts to have facilities to keep witnesses separate from defendants within four years more video links will also be made available so that witnesses do not have to enter courtrooms it is part of a fiveyear plan to help build confidence in the justice system ministers say the strategy is aimed at rebalancing the court system towards victims and increasing the number of offenders brought to justice launching the department for constitutional affairs plan lord falconer said one of the top priorities will be a better deal for victims the needs and safety of victims will be at the heart of the way trials are managed courts judges magistrates prosecutors police and victim support all working together to ensure the rights of victims are put first without compromising the rights of the defendant he went on giving evidence is a nervewracking experience especially when youre a victim yet with a will and with support it can be done lord falconer told bbc radio s today programme it was impossible for some elderly people to go to court to give evidence other witnesses could be intimidated by sitting alongside defendants outside courts you are never going to get rid of some element of the trauma of giving evidence he said but you can make people believe that the courts understand the problem its not some kind of alien place where they go where they are not thinking about them the plan comes as the lord chancellor also considers allowing cameras into courts for the first time since as long as they were used for cases that did not involve witnesses another feature of the strategy is constitutional reform with a government bill to set up a supreme court and a judicial appointments commission returning to the house of lords on tuesday ministers had proposed getting rid of the title of lord chancellor but the lords have overruled this lord falconer said it was right for the highest court to be completely distinct from parliament the person in charge of the court system should not also be speaker of the house of lords he said and should be the best person chosen from either house of parliament what they did not what they were called was the critical issue he added lord scarman dies peacefully distinguished lawyer lord scarman who conducted the inquiry into the brixton riots has died aged the peer enjoyed a celebrated judicial career serving as law commission chairman in its first seven years he also chaired the tribunal set up to investigate civil disturbances in northern ireland paying tribute the lord chancellor lord falconer said lord scarman was one of the great advocates of our generation his legacy from his decisions in the lords and the court of appeal is substantial his work in the wake of the brixton riots and his commitment to the vulnerable and dispossessed was second to none a great judge a great lawyer and a great man lord scarmans nephew george ritchie said the peer who passed away peacefully on wednesday would be sadly missed the lord chief justice lord woolf who is the most senior judge in england and wales said it was lord scarmans pioneering work which paved the way for the human rights act he was a lawyer and a judge who had a remarkable insight into human nature and an exceptional sensitivity to the needs of a healthy society he said he was personally totally charming and he will be remembered with great affection and admiration by all who came into contact with him dame elizabeth butlersloss the president of the family justice division said lord scarman was a good and humane judge and one of the greatest figures of the late th century lord scarman will be remembered for the public inquiry he led into a string of race riots which began in brixton when racial tensions rose after a police crackdown on street robbery during the following three days of disturbances that spread to the midlands merseyside bristol and leeds nearly people were injured and buildings and vehicles were set alight the inquiry famously settled on the socalled rotten apples theory which argued that only a few police officers were racist saying most were not it spawned new law enforcement practices and led to the creation of the police complaints authority trevor phillips chair of the commission for racial equality praised lord scarmans ability to listen he said when lord scarman toured the streets of brixton his presence was electrifying a community which had been systematically ignored by everyone else was suddenly embraced by the epitome of the english establishment his great quality was the ability to listen to young people of all backgrounds many of whose language he could barely understand genuinely to hear what they had to say and to talk to them as human beings he never lost the special combination of wisdom humanity and the spark of radicalism that marked his watershed report into the brixton riots tory leader urges harry apology prince harry should personally make clear how sorry he is about wearing a nazi uniform to a friends fancy dress party says tory leader michael howard mr howard whose grandmother died in auschwitz said many people would be offended by the princes actions clarence house has issued a statement saying the prince has apologised and realised it had been a poor costume number said an error was made but now harry had apologised the matter should be left to the palace that was a message repeated by home secretary charles clarke who said the matter should now be left to lie but lib dem leader charles kennedy said harry was in a privileged position and said he should apologise in person there is a reservoir of goodwill for prince harry and prince william with him in this country but i think he needs to remember that it cant last forever he added that sandhurst would probably be good for harry as it would teach him some self discipline former labour mp lord janner who is a high profile member of britains jewish community branded harrys actions stupid and evil he told itv the time has come for him to make a public apology it is about common decency of respect to the people who fought the nazis to the families of those who were killed by the nazis and to people who suffered during the holocaust he added i would send him in the army as fast as possible i hope that would teach him not to behave like that a photograph of prince harry wearing a swastika armband and german desert uniform at the party appears in thursdays sun newspaper under the headline harry the nazi mr howard acknowledged the princes apology and said he had no doubt the princes father and family would have much to say to him privately about the incident but he told bbc radio s today programme it might be appropriate to tell us himself just how contrite he is mr howard declined to say what form the statement should take but former buckingham palace press spokesman dicky arbiter said the prince should make a personal broadcast apology mr clarke said he recognised peoples concerns about the costume but argued he has apologised and i think we should leave the matter there nhs waiting time target is cut hospital waiting times for patients in wales are to be cut but not to the same extent as those in england welsh health minister jane hutt said no patient would wait more than months for an outpatient appointment by march against a current target of months but she said the target for an inpatient appointment would remain at months for march the announcement came as new monthly waiting figures showed a drop this current inpatient target was set when the assembly government extended its second offer guarantee scheme which gives patients the option of having their treatment outside wales details about funding to resource the new targets are expected in the new year in england the current target for inpatients seeing a consultant to having an operation is six months dr richard lewis welsh secretary of the british medical association bma welcomed the new targets to make further and faster progress on waiting lists however much remains to be done on waiting lists and waiting times because wales still lags a long way behind england he said capacity must be built into the system with sustained investment to ensure that welsh patients dont receive a worse service than patients over the border health analyst tony beddow from the welsh institute for health and social care called the new targets reasonably impressive on wednesday ms hutt also announced m for health services will be spent reducing waiting times improving key areas and modernising staff pay structures in wales ms hutt said major achievements had been made in cutting unacceptably long waits for treatment over the past year we are turning the corner on long waits in wales now we need to see those reductions in long waiters being improved again she said she added the targets intended to ensure noone waits more than a year for treatment or to see a consultant but let us not forget two thirds of those waiting for treatment now are waiting less than six months and these targets affect the small minority of patients in wales that are waiting far too long rhodri glyn thomas plaid cymru health spokesman said its exactly the same target she set in with the qualification that its dependent on a second offer its a failed target from a failed ministerwith a failed policy for the welsh liberal democrats kirsty williams called the new target hugely unambitious it leaves patients in wales still waiting two years before theyre treated conservative health spokesman jonathan morgan said were spending more money but waiting lists have gone through the roof the audit commission has said that the money is not being spent efficiently or effectively and thats quite a criticism meanwhile the latest monthly waiting list figures showed the total number of people waiting more than months as an inpatient in wales has fallen by statistics to the end of november showed a decline since october from to the number waiting over months also fell from to or ms hutt said they were excellent figures there are people on a waiting list of some kind down from last month ukip candidate suspended eurosceptic party ukip have suspended a candidate for allegedly suggesting the criminally insane should be killed john houston was due to stand in the east kilbride seat in lanarkshire at the next election but he was suspended after his reported views including the return of the british empire were sent to two scottish newspapers ukip spokesman mark croucher said those who selected mr houston knew nothing of his views the episode comes at a difficult time for ukip soon after the highprofile departure of mep robert kilroysilk mr houston is alleged to have said that the organs of the criminally insane should be made available to lawabiding members of the community and proposed the legalisation of drugs and the sex trade the document reportedly said were looking for the resurrection of the british empire the problems for the human race environmental and others can only be dealt with on a global scale and that calls for a radical alliance of the englishspeaking nations which they are uniquely able to do mr croucher said the main issue would be that mr houstons reported views had been presented as ukip policy which they were not he said they might have been submissions to a committee working on the partys manifesto but would not have been matched to mr houston when he was standing to become a candidate he told bbc news he appears to have said these things we have suspended him as a member and as a candidate by all accounts none of this was mentioned at his selection meeting it is simply a distraction from the task in hand the eu constitution not individual idiocies mr houston was quoted in the herald newspaper saying i feel ukip have overreacted and overshot the runway peter nielson who is ukip scotland chairman said he had suspended mr houston on friday night he will remain suspended while the matter is being investigated and then we will decide if and what further action will be taken he said that any evidence would be looked into and mr houston may be interviewed by the party he added i cant comment too much at the moment i have one version from him but i havent seen the papers yet end bush denial blair tells eu tony blair is urging european leaders to wake up from their state of denial over president bushs reelection america has spoken the rest of the world should listen the prime minister said in an interview with the times newspaper published on friday mr blair is at a summit in brussels where iraq and european justice and immigration plans are on the agenda french president jacques chirac reacted to his warning by saying europe instead needed to reinforce its own unity mr blair has probably been closer to president bush than any other european leader he said some people were in a sort of state of denial about the us election result but predicted a more receptive mood would emerge soon america needed to listen to the world too he said the fact is that president bush is there for four years he is there because the american people have chosen him he argued he also made clear he intended to take seriously what he perceives as his role in bringing the two continents together britain was uniquely placed to make out the common ground because of its strong alliance with the us he suggested he admitted he had gone to bed at gmt well before the american polls closed thinking mr kerry might have won he woke up at gmt to discover mr bush had won but declined to say if he was pleased with the eventual result his words about president bush met a cool reception from jacques chirac the french president told reporters europe today has more than ever the need the necessity to reinforce itself and its dynamism and unity that is the goal of the constitution in a world that is more multipolar than ever mr chirac will miss an address to the summit from iraqi interim leader iyad allawi who this week criticised nations which took a spectator role to iraqs reconstruction mr chirac denied there was any snub he is going to a memorial service for the united arab emirates late leader and says he would be happy to meet mr allawi he also signed a communiqu stressing the eus commitment to securing a stable and unified iraq the eu also confirmed a new m aid package the communiqu congratulated president bush on his victory and stressed the importance of good transatlantic relations the summit is also expected to agree changes to streamline european asylum and immigration decisions mr blair recently said the uk would only participate in euwide measures where it was in uk interests but the tories say he is surrendering a key veto the meeting will also assess progress on the economic reform plans agreed in lisbon in to make europe more competitive brown shrugs off economy fears gordon brown is to freeze petrol duty increases fund a bn package to avoid big council tax rises and boost childcare and maternity leave in an upbeat prebudget report he slightly increased borrowing but insisted economic targets would be met the chancellor also hailed the longest period of growth in uk industrial history but denied he was gloating but oliver letwin for the tories attacked government red tape and debt dubbing mr brown sir wastealot the shadow chancellor said mr browns golden rule had turned to dross in his hands and said he was borrowing to spend not invest with predicted debt over the coming years totalling bn mr letwin told mps the tide is going out on the chancellors credibility he is spending borrowing and taxing so much because he is not getting value for taxpayers money vincent cable for the liberal democrats accused mr brown of ducking tough choices he said last week the prime minister gave us the politics of fear this week the chancellor has offered the economics of complacency there are serious challenges ahead from the falling dollar and from the rapid downturn in the uk housing market and rising personal debt but they have not been confronted mr brown rejected the lib dems call to open up the governments books to the national audit office saying decisions on tax and spending should be made by ministers some economists say his forecasts on public finances are wishful thinking bbc economic editor evan davis said the figures were plausible but also a gamble mr browns insistence he was not gloating was a pointed rebuttal of a warning from new european commissioner peter mandelson in his speech he set out a year childcare strategy for if labour wins the next election it includes a m cash injection to extend paid maternity leave from six months to nine with parents able to transfer leave from the mother to the father he also promised to increase free nursery education for three and fouryearolds to hours from april and funds would be provided to keep schools open from to gmt to look after children while their parents were at work taken together the measures would create a welfare state that is truly familyfriendly for the first time in its history said mr brown he also announced a cash handout for older pensioners with payments of for the overs as part of the winter fuel allowance in a move ministers say should keep council tax rises below next year the chancellor said he was providing an extra bn for local councils the money is expected to come from government departments such as health and education mr brown said he was set to meet his two fiscal rules to borrow only to invest and keep debt low and sustainable both in this economic cycle and the next borrowing figures for are bn bn less than the bn predicted in marchs budget as already announced by the office for national statistics borrowing is tipped to fall to bn by but that is still bn more than mr brown predicted in his march budget inflation would be next year and in the years to follow mr brown forecast he also pledged an extra m for security and counterterrorism business groups have welcomed efforts to improve competitiveness and invest more in skills and innovation but there worries about the costs of more familyfriendly working simon sweetman from the federation of small businesses said the proposals on maternity leave have clearly been made with a general election in mind and with little thought to the impact on small employers blair told to double overseas aid tony blair is being urged to use all his negotiating powers to end poor countries debt and double aid some million children will die needlessly before and aid budgets are half their levels oxfam says in a report paying the price the call comes as the prime minister prepares to assume the presidency of the g of top industrialised nations as rich countries get richer theyre giving less and less this scandal must stop oxfams barbara stocking said the worlds poorest children are paying for rich countries policies in aid and debt with their lives offers the chance for an historic breakthrough but unless world leaders act now the year will end in shameful failure the charitys director added the report said for rich countries providing aid to help to end global poverty is an obligation and a matter of justice not an act of charity it also points out that in the g of top industrialised nations agreed to spend of their incomes on aid but years later none of the organisations members have reached this target and many have not yet set a timetable the report says it argues that the price of not investing in poor countries sustainable development will be felt across the world the report said global poverty threatens our shared prosperity and security environmental crises and natural disasters disease and drug trafficking know no national borders poverty heightens the likelihood of conflict and unrest new threats to the peace and security of rich nations arise from poverty and gross inequalities criminal and terrorist networks are more likely to operate where state institutions are weak both the prime minister and chancellor gordon brown have called for urgent action to fight world poverty mr blair who has described africa as a scar on the worlds conscience has already said tackling world poverty would be one his g priorities along with climate change and the aids epidemic mr brown has also pledged to write off the debt owed to britain by the worlds poor nations a spokeswoman for the department for international development said the government had made a clear commitment to reaching of gross national income for overseas development aid by if britains proposal for an international finance facility were adopted the objective of could be achieved earlier by these additional resources will be used to increase uk bilateral aid to africa to at least bn a year by and spend at least bn on hivaids related work over the next three years retirement age could be scrapped the myth that ageing is a barrier to contributing to society needs to be exploded the work and pensions minister has said this was why the government was considering scrapping the retirement age entirely alan johnson said it was also committed to stamping out age discrimination and would outlaw it he told a conference on ageing all three parties have been wooing older voters with both the tories and lib dems pledging higher pensions mr johnson told age concerns age agenda in london the government was seriously considering introducing pensions based on residency rather than national insurance contributions this idea has been adopted by the lib dems as policy while the tories have pledged to boost pensions by restoring the link between earnings and pensions mr johnsons speech comes after he last week unveiled plans to find a consensus on how to reform the countrys pension system this would be based on a series of principles including tackling pensioner poverty and fairer pensions for women he said speaking at the london conference he said generalised stereotypes of people past state pension age as dependant incapable and vulnerable are a particularly pernicious form of age discrimination the government wanted to tackle this by moving to a culture where retirement ages were increasingly consigned to the past were sweeping them away entirely for people under and were giving those above that age a right to request to work past which their employers will have to engage with seriously and the review in which will look at whether it is time to sweep retirement ages away entirely is to be tied to evidence showing that retirement ages are increasingly outmoded mr johnson said his department had a longterm aspiration of moving towards an employment rate this would involve an extra one million older people joining the work force he said blair says uk tsunami aid to soar tony blair has predicted the british government will eventually give hundreds of millions of pounds in aid to countries hit by the tsunami the prime minister was speaking publicly for the first time since returning from his holiday in egypt mr blair insisted he had been intimately involved in all decisions at all times despite being abroad he was speaking before the uk joins a threeminute silence at noon across the eu for the estimated dead the foreign office says britons are now confirmed to have died in the tsunami which struck south asia on boxing day with others missing asked about criticism that he did not cut short his holiday mr blair told bbc radio s today programme i dont think this is a situation in which the british people need me to articulate what they feel i think they feel as we all do shock horror and absolute solidarity with those people who have lost their lives the important thing was action and not words he said adding that of the m given by the government so far only six or seven million had been spent it would become easier in the coming weeks to assess just how much money would have to be put in my estimate is we will need to spend from government several hundred million pounds so we will far and away more than match the generosity of the british people he said asked whether he had not returned to work immediately because he was under doctors orders to rest mr blair said there was also a story he had been away for plastic surgery as you can see unfortunately i am still looking the same as i always did he joked the prime minister took personal charge of the uks response on tuesday chairing a meeting of the emergency committee of ministers that has convened daily since boxing day he also spoke on the telephone to us president george bush and the presidents of sri lanka and indonesia chancellor gordon brown earlier backed a plan to freeze the foreign debts of all the affected nations mr brown who was not at the downing street meeting says he has been in intensive talks with other g finance ministers germany proposed a freeze last week and canada has begun its own moratorium the chancellor said the plan would initially save the most affected countries about bn bn in repayments tory leader michael howard also backed the proposals but said ministers had been playing catchup with public donations foreign secretary jack straw is to visit thailand and indonesia this week during his trip mr straw will represent the g at the international conference called in jakarta indonesia on thursday on friday he will visit the thai beach resort of phuket where british families are still searching for relatives international development secretary hilary benn will also visit aceh in

also being sent uk charities have also begun chartering planes to deliver aid a bbc news special asia remembered including the threeminutes silence will be shown on bbc one and bbc news from to gmt on wednesday straw attacked on china arms moves to lift the european unions ban on arms exports to china have been condemned by human rights groups and the conservatives the year embargo was imposed in the aftermath of chinas crackdown on protesters in tiananmen square in uk foreign secretary jack straw who will hold talks in beijing on thursday said an eu arms code was more effective than the current ban but human rights watch says the eu is putting commerce above abuse concerns in december the eu pledged to work towards lifting the ban but said it was not ready to do so yet germany and france have repeatedly called for the embargo to be lifted britain has been more cautious but mr straw last week said he also wanted it to end despite us objections he expects it to be lifted over the next six months a prediction which has alarmed critics brad adams from human rights watch said this is a huge political signal from europe that they are willing to forget about tiananmen square there are still thousands of people who are unaccounted for mr straw said it was wrong to put china under the same embargo as countries such as zimbabwe and burma the scope of the embargo was very narrow and did not have any force of law behind it he told bbc radio s world at one in the uk more export licences were refused under the existing european union arms code than under the embargo he said and only two of the licences denied under the embargo would have been granted under the code the code of conduct is much more effective its a more powerful tool of and we intend to strengthen it as a precondition of lifting the embargo with china he said mr straw denied the decision would suggest to china that tiananmen square had been forgotten the level of human rights was a key criteria under the eu arms exports code he said human rights groups say the code of conduct is not legally binding but mr straw said it would be given legal force by the laws of many eu countries conservative shadow foreign secretary michael ancram said the move would be profoundly wrong the decision could undermine nato as it severely damaged relations with the us which is opposed to ending the ban mr ancram argued what the british government is doing is giving in to french and german pressure especially the french who see vast contracts available to them if the embargo is lifted it gives the wrong signals to china who are simply not prepared to accept that what happened at tiananmen square was wrong mr straws china trip is part of regular highlevel meetings with beijing ministers he will meet chinese counterpart minister li zhaoxing to discuss developing relations between their two countries hong kong and chinas part in the talks on north korea eu fraud clampdown urged eu member states are failing to report fraud and irregularities in eu funds on a consistent basis the uks public spending watchdog has said the national audit office said although the latest figures showed reported fraud was falling the eu still had no common definition of fraud it also expressed concern that for the th year the european court of auditors had qualified the eu accounts the nao urged the government to push for improvements in reporting fraud it said member states needed to be more accountable on how money was spent the report said member states still do not report fraud and other irregularities to the european antifraud office on a consistent basis as the court has now qualified its opinion on the community accounts for a decade it is essential for all the authorities involved to contribute to the strengthening of the audit of eu revenue and expenditure and improving accountability for the financial management and use of eu resources it said there were cases of reported fraud or irregularities in eu funds in the uk in worth m m euros up from cases worth m in at the same time reported fraud throughout the eu dropped from cases worth m to cases worth m edward leigh chairman of the commons public accounts committee said britain had to set an example when it assumed the eu presidency any fraud in other member states is potentially fraud against the uk taxpayer given that we are the second largest net contributor to the community he said departments responsible for administering eu funds need to make sure that theyre doing everything possible to weed out improper spending the government must take the opportunity afforded by the uk presidency of the eu to press the commission and other member states to take an equally robust stance against fraud and irregularity and raise overall standards of financial management a spokesman for the european antifraud office said the organisation agreed with the naos assessment of fraud reporting the quality of reporting does differ from member state to member state and there is room for improvement spokesman jorg wojahn said he added that there is generally good cooperation with member states and the antifraud office on specific cases of fraud with the statistics studied by nao providing a good overview for planning strategic ways of detecting fraud straw praises kashmir moves the uk has welcomed the decision by india and pakistan to open a bus link across the ceasefire line dividing the disputed region of kashmir foreign secretary jack straw touring south east asian countries praised the spirit of cooperation in achieving the breakthrough media reports in both countries describe the deal as a major step in the ongoing peace process mr straw said he hoped the agreement would make a difference to kashmiris the bus service was one of several announcements made after a meeting of foreign ministers of both countries in islamabad on wednesday kashmiri politicians on both sides of the line of control which divides the region welcomed the move in a statement mr straw said the bus service between srinagar and muzaffarabad will be able to reunite families that have been divided for decades this will make a real difference to the lives of kashmiris on both sides of the line of control he said i warmly applaud the efforts of both india and pakistan to make this happen this spirit of cooperation will i hope lead to many more measures that will benefit all in the region on thursday mr straw was in india visiting sikhisms holiest shrine the golden temple in amritsar where he tried his hand at making indian bread or roti he is due to take part in talks with the indian government on friday a second bus service linking the pakistani city of lahore with amritsar in india was also announced as well as a rail link between rajasthan state and pakistans sindh province both sides agreed to begin talks on reducing the risk of nuclear accidents and also said they planned to reopen their respective consulates in karachi and mumbai bombay the mountainous region of kashmir has been a flashpoint between the two nuclear powers for more than years uk helps raped rwandan women britain is to give a m grant to help women survivors of the rwandan genocide who were raped and often deliberately infected with hivaids an estimated girls and women were raped during the genocide about tutsis and moderate hutus were killed by hutu militias after the assassination of an ethnic hutu leader the fiveyear department for international development funding will enable more survivors to have access to antiretroviral treatment the plight of the infected women was overshadowed for a long time it was overshadowed by rwandas emergence from the days of slaughter during which time the mass killings took place and the womens fate was largely a taboo subject but many of the women were widowed and they now not only have their own children to care for but in many cases orphans too as the women die the number of rwandas orphans rises until recently very few of the women have had access to antiretroviral treatment that is now starting to change this funding is intended to make antiretrovirals and other care available for some women mary kayitesi blewitt founder of the survivors fund surf one of the organisations through which the funds are being channelled said it was a recognition before it was too late that the survivors should be a priority for help eu referendum question unveiled the question to be asked in the referendum on the eu constitution has been unveiled by the government it will be should the united kingdom approve the treaty establishing a constitution for the european union the constitution will be incorporated into uk law if there is a yes vote in the referendum expected in critics say the constitution is a further step towards a federal europe but advocates say it ensures effective operation of the enlarged state eu if we reject this treaty britain will be isolated and weak in europe said foreign secretary jack straw who along with the rest of the cabinet will back a yes vote patriots by definition wanted the uk to be prosperous at home and strong and influential abroad mr straw said our role as a leading member of the eu is a crucial part of securing that conservative shadow foreign secretary michael ancram said the referendum question seems straightforward but he accused the government of trying to confuse the issue by putting the eu referendum question in the same bill as the ratification of the constitution when they should be treated as two separate issues despite this underhand trick the referendum bill stood no chance of becoming law before the election he added this is tony blairs cheap gesture to the proconstitution lobby while he runs scared of a debate on europe he knows he cannot win neil obrien director of anticonstitution group vote no said the reality is that the government doesnt want to discuss the eu constitution ahead of the election because they know it is extremely unpopular with voters and with business the uk independence party said if the government believes that a no vote would mean that we should leave the european union they should just ask us if we want to leave the eu then we can be out of it and better off much sooner liberal democrat leader charles kennedy who backs the constitution said he expected the referendum would come in the first half of next year he told bbc radio s today programme the sooner we get on with this the better he said the question sounded very neutral and balanced adding it would enable the argument to be enjoined fairly and squarely on both sides green mep caroline lucas welcomed tony blairs courage in keeping his word on holding a referendum but she added this treaty is a flawed document that will make the eu less accountable less sustainable and less just mr blair signed the constitution at a ceremony in rome in november but had already made it clear the issue would be put to voters in a referendum that promise came after sustained pressure from opposition parties jack straw who argues the constitution reflected a british vision for europe and gives national governments a stronger grip has said the referendum could be held in spring but in an interview with the financial times mr blair refused to be pinned down to that date saying britain would hold a poll some time in but when i dont know the paper said the prime minister claimed ignorance of when other countries were planning to hold their referendums malik rejects allblack mp lists a call for ethnic minority shortlists to boost the number of black and asian mps has been rejected by one of labours most senior asians shahid malik who is on labours ruling nec accepted peoples frustration but said there should be targets not lists to boost representation of minorities just of britains mps are from ethnic minority groups he added commission for racial equality chief trevor phillips argued on sunday the time had come for such shortlists that came after it emerged that one of britains most ethnically diverse constituency west ham was to get a womenonly shortlist for the next election following an nec ruling mr phillips said changes to the race relations legislation might allow political parties to reserve seats for underrepresented groups for example in west ham this might allow only women and minorities to seek to be candidates if we get to the other side of the general election and find that minorities are not represented we have to say that after or years of talking about this we cannot go on the same way he said he added it would be terribly disappointing if in the least white constituency west ham in the whole of europe we didnt have a minority candidate appearing on bbc radio s today programme mr malik who is himself running for the seat of dewsbury acknowledged that so far womenonly shortlists had failed to deliver a boost in the number of ethnic minority candidates but he argued i do think that there currently things that parties can do and which they arent doing for example setting targets to ensure that existing democratic structures are more reflective labour mp diane abbot who backs mr phillips proposal of shortlists said she had been elected along with three other ethnic minority mps keith vaz paul boateng and bernie grant in but it took another years before another black woman was able to win a seat that was a rate of progress ms abbott described as painful i am a little older than shahid and served on the national executive committee in the s i was the first black person on the nec crossing our fingers and hoping we are going to get more black and asian mp hasnt worked she said the shortlist strategy works for women and i believe that it can be made to work for black and asian people on tuesday labour chairman ian mccartney said his party was ambitious to improve black and asian representation we havent ruled out allblack shortlists and welcome a debate in the party about this he said mp attacked by muggers in kenya an mp has had more than and his passport stolen after being mugged by six men in a park in kenya quentin davies the mp for grantham and stamford was attacked in a notoriously dangerous park in the capital nairobi he was not hurt in the mugging on saturday evening several people are being questioned over the attack he was in kenya before travelling to sudan with the parliamentary committee local police were said to be surprised he was in the area mr davies said the mugging occurred yards from the nairobi serena hotel and equally close to the anglican cathedral in the centre of the city at dusk he said in a statement it was a frightening experience six men managed to steal up on me and grab me from behind i knew i had to stay very calm and passive you cannot fight six men he had to spend an extra hours in nairobi before rejoining the rest of the house of commons international development committee in dafur after the mugging naturally i was afraid they would use a knife or gun though they never produced any weapon he said two of them held me from behind and two others held my legs and another one expertly rifled all my pockets labour accused of broken pledge labour has already broken its preelection promise on immigration before the ink has dried on its new pledge card the tories have claimed home secretary charles clarke has been quoted as telling labour members he wants more migrants to come to the uk tory cochairman liam fox said the comments were at odds with tony blairs prediction of a net cut in immigration but mr clarke accused him of trying to score cheap political points by muddling immigration with asylum londons evening standard quoted mr clarke telling labour activists at a question and answer session in gateshead that he wanted britain to offer refuge for those fleeing tyranny thats not only a moral duty and a legal duty but something which is part of the essence of this country he said we want more migration more people come to study and to work we want more people coming to look for refuge mr blairs was asked last wednesday if the governments new immigration plans including a point system for economic migrants would reduce net migration the prime minister told mps the abusers will be weeded out and as a result of the end of chain migration where families have an automatic right to settle the numbers will probably fall on monday dr fox told reporters the prime minister has broken his word so many times in the past but now his promises do not even last a week the labour party election pledges even when they are so incredibly vague do not even last four days the tories want quotas for economic migrants and refugees and on tuesday will outline more details of their plans for health checks on migrants mr clarke dismissed the latest tory attack this is simply a scurrilous attempt by the tories to score cheap political points he said the tories are purposely mixing together two separate issues of immigration and asylum mr clarke said he had made clear the uk would welcome genuine economic migrants for key jobs on a strict points based system and only asylum seekers genuinely fleeing death or persecution would be admitted under our plans we expect unfounded applications to continue to fall he added earlier dr fox accused mr blair and other cabinet ministers of telling lies about tory policies and then attacking the lies he told bbc radio if you are willing to lie about the reasons for going to war i guess you are going to lie about anything at all the latest preelection spats come after mr blair told labour members the tories offered a hard right agenda which would take britain backwards lib dem leader charles kennedy accelerating lib dem election preparations this week as he visits manchester liverpool leicester somerset basingstoke

his israeli counterpart ariel sharon and the palestinian leader mahmoud abbas he confirmed that a renewed drive to reform the palestinian authority and address security issues would come at a london conference in march mr blair also made a surprise trip to iraq this week the israelis described the meeting as important but said they would not need to attend mr blair briefly visited the tomb of yasser arafat in ramallah the first world leader to do so he nodded briefly towards the tomb rather than lay a wreath in what palestinian officials said was a compromise gesture agreed at the last minute the bbcs paul reynolds says the london conference will be a limited measure to shore up the leadership of mahmoud abbas also known as abu mazen who is expected to win the palestinian presidential election on january at a news conference following talks with mr blair mr abbas said the british prime minister was in a unique position to help us progress in our peaceful pursuit he added your endeavour to hold a conference in london is another example of your deep commitment to this purpose in an interview with the bbcs political editor andrew marr mr blair said getting progress between israelis and palestinians would be tough but at least we have got the first step mr blair acknowledged some people believed he was too close to the israelis but said the israelis were entitled to expect palestinians to give up terrorism he argued that mr sharon was committed to the internationallyagreed roadmap peace plan and said his bid to disengage from gaza had to be part of the peace process not the end of it earlier mr sharon again said he had not seen the slightest step the palestinians were working to end terror attacks though he acknowledged palestinian leaders were in the middle of an election campaign that could be hampering their efforts before visiting israel mr blair made a surprise visit to iraq where he met leaders in baghdad during his first trip to the city he was briefed on preparations for the national poll which is scheduled for next month but is threatened by a deadly campaign of insurgent violence he also flew to basra in southern iraq where british forces are stationed galloway plea for hostage release exlabour mp george galloway has appealed for the release of aid worker margaret hassan kidnapped in iraq mrs hassan who led care international operations in iraq was abducted in baghdad on october mr galloway was expelled from the labour party because of his staunch opposition to the war on iraq he denied an earlier report that he planned to make a direct appeal to the kidnappers via the aljazeera arabic television channel speaking in london on saturday at the first annual delegate conference of his newlyfounded party the respect coalition he said i have deliberately not involved myself before in any of these situations but this woman has been a prominent opponent of both the war and the preceding years of sanctions i am prepared to do anything i can to help save her life a spokesman later said mr galloway had friends in common with ms hassan who he described as a prominent antiwar activist and that he was willing to do anything go to iraq or be an intermediary or anything thats necessary since her abduction several videos of mrs hassan have been broadcast by aljazeera the latest footage showed mrs hassan asking for british troops to be pulled out of iraq she also urged care international the aid agency she works for to close its office in baghdad and appealed for iraqi women prisoners to be freed care has since closed down all its operations in iraq guantanamo four questioned the four britons freed from us custody in guantanamo bay are expected to be allowed a visit by one relative moazzam begg martin mubanga feroz abbasi and richard belmar were held for three years accused of alqaeda links mr beggs father azmat said he had been told he could see his son for minutes and would say he was a hero the men are being held at londons paddington green police station where they are expected to be questioned by uk antiterror officers but louise christian the lawyer representing mr abbasi and mr mubanga said the families would be reunited with the men away from the station before being driven by police from birmingham to london azmat begg said he was concerned for his son moazzams mental state and was looking forward to giving him a hug as azmat begg arrived at the london police station there appeared to be some confusion as to the visiting arrangements police have said they have a duty to investigate the men who were arrested on their return to the uk but metropolitan police commissioner sir john stevens said evidence obtained by mi while the four were in cuba was absolutely inadmissible in uk courts in an interview with the independent sir john said his officers would have to find other evidence before the suspects could be tried in the uk he told the newspaper if an admission is made it is a totally different ball game it could be used as evidence the options are if there is enough evidence they will be charged if not they will be released as soon as possible the men have been allowed to meet their lawyers louise christian said that after being tortured and abused at guantanamo bay the mens arrest was unfair and inappropriate she told bbc news she remained very concerned about their psychological state gareth peirce lawyer for mr begg said she was shocked at the condition of the men and appalled that the authorities felt the need to detain them washington has claimed all four were enemy combatants who trained at camps run by alqaeda the pentagon says they were freed after the uk government promised they would not be a threat to the national security of the us or any of its allies the detainees were immediately arrested under section of the terrorism act when they landed at raf northolt west london on tuesday massoud shadjareh from the muslim safety forum said what sort of homecoming is this they are innocent people the muslim council of britain urged that the men should receive counselling and medical help we want these men to be returned into the arms of their waiting family said iqbal sacranie secretary general of the council minister defends hunting ban law the law banning hunting with dogs in england and wales is enforceable and very clear alun michael has said the rural affairs minister said it would become obvious if people flouted the law which came into force on friday and pretended they were not some hunts met legally on saturday killing a total of foxes only four were accidentally killed by hounds but antihunt campaigners said there had been widespread intimidation of activists monitoring hunts countryside alliance chairman john jackson said that saturday had been a massive demonstration by the rural community of support for hunting people had turned out to show en masse that the hunting act was a bad law he said adding that foxes and other animals had been killed legally as far as he was aware although hunting with dogs is now a criminal offence exercising hounds chasing a scent trail and flushing out foxes to be shot are still legal addressing claims that the new law was unenforceable mr michael told bbc radio s today programme there has been a lot of spin about this by those that support hunting the reality is that the law is very clear you cant chase wild mammals with a pack of dogs whether the wild mammal is a fox or a deer if people do so and pretend theyre not its going to become very clear you cant hunt accidentally mr michael also denied the hunting ban had led to a breakdown of trust between the government and rural communities he said most people living in the countryside were more concerned with issues like the economy the health service and their childrens future than hunting but the league against cruel sports claimed the new act had been broken even though the numbers of foxes killed had fallen thousands of hunt supporters turned out at hunts across england and wales on the first day of the ban with antihunt groups sending out monitors to check the law was not being broken there were only four arrests over alleged hunting of hares in wiltshire although it was not clear whether they were made under the hunting act they have been released on bail but police say they may face prosecution under new poaching laws but penny little who monitored the bicester hunt in oxfordshire said she had witnessed gratuitous spiteful killing of foxes if people tried to run circles around this law the only outcome would be that it was tightened up she said mike hobday from the league against cruel sports said video evidence of the law being broken would be passed onto police he said intimidation seemed to have been widespread and called on hunts to do more to stop their supporters intimidating antihunt activists videoing hunts but mr jackson who had been at the bicester hunt in oxfordshire denied there was any intimidation clarke to unveil immigration plan new controls on economic migrants and tighter border patrols will be part of government plans unveiled on monday home secretary charles clarke wants to introduce a points system for economic migrants and increase deportations of failed asylum seekers tony blair has said people are right to be concerned about abuses of the system but there is no magic bullet the tories say labour is acting too late while the lib dems say the plans may not produce an efficient system the governments new fiveyear plan is designed to show how labour would reform immigration and asylum controls if it wins the election expected to be held in may ministers deny they have been spurred into action by tory campaigning or because the prime minister is worried too little has been done instead they say the plans are part of an evolving process aimed at winning public confidence mr clarke is expected to announce an end to the automatic right to settle for immigrants families and the introduction of fingerprinting for all visa applicants the prime minister on sunday said immigration would be toughened up to ensure only those immigrants with skills the uk really needs will be granted work permits but he rejected the tories call for a quota on economic migrants saying no arbitrary figure could reflect the uks needs mr blair told bbc radio s westminster hour we should cut the number or increase it depending on the countrys needs the public are worried about this they are worried rightly because there are abuses of the immigration and asylum system but he defended the uks current regime saying all systems around the world were subject to abuse tory proposals to cap the number of asylum seekers and process all claims abroad would not work argued mr blair he said we will not be pretending there is some simple easy way of processing britains asylum seekers in some other country because no such other country exists conservative shadow home secretary david davis said the government had failed to remove failed asylum seekers from the uk and limits on economic migrants had been a shambles what we are seeing today is a rather panicky response from the government after eight years of failure he said liberal democrat home affairs spokesman mark oaten said labour was right to reject the tories idea of quotas on asylum but he said it was yet to be seen if mr clarke could deliver a fair and efficient asylum system mayor will not retract nazi jibe london mayor ken livingstone has again refused to retract a nazi insult made to a jewish reporter labours mr livingstone who says he is standing by his remarks had accused an evening standard journalist of being like a concentration camp guard at his weekly press conference on tuesday he said his comments were not racist and refused to apologise he said to media representatives if you think they are racist i think you are wrong the mayor said his comments would not affect the olympic bid and added that his determination to stand up for what he believed in may impress bid chiefs who arrived in london on tuesday i think it is important that the ioc international olympic committee members realise that when we get the gamesthey have a mayor who is not going to panic change course or get in a great flap but will deliver the games on time and to budget he said on tuesday the mayor said he would be making a full written response to the chairman of the assembly two motions were passed by the london assembly which is made up of members elected to examine the mayors activities on monday asking him to apologise and withdraw his comments the mayor said he had recounted to the assembly a number of examples of intrusion by journalists into his and his familys private life i dont suggest for one minute that has anything to do with the holocaust which was uniquely the most evil chapter in history but when reporters say to me im only doing this because its my job thats the same abdication of moral responsibility at the thin end of the wedge that in its most extreme and horrific version ends up with others being prepared to stand as a concentration camp guard we are responsible for our own choices in this life i always have been and so have reporters an official complaint has been made to local government watchdogs by the board of deputies of british jews demanding an investigation by the standards board of england it has the power to suspended or bar him from office but mr livingstone said there must have been instances like this over the last years i have never in response to any of that modified a policy i believed to be right or modified a position i believed to be right and i dont intend to now because if i do that effectively you hand power over your policies and position to the editors of papers on tape mr livingstone who once worked as a freelance restaurant critic on the paper is heard asking reporter oliver finegold if he is a german war criminal mr finegold replies no im jewish i wasnt a german war criminal im quite offended by that the mayor then says ah right well you might be but actually you are just like a concentration camp guard you are just doing it because you are paid to arent you pakistani women must not hide hiding women away in the home hidden behind veils is a backward view of islam president musharraf of pakistan has said during a visit to britain he was speaking to the bbcs newsnight programme a few hours before visiting the pakistani community in manchester my wife is travelling around she is very religious but she is very moderate said general musharraf it comes after pakistans high commissioner to britain said some pakistanis should integrate more dr maleeha lodhi said people could not expect others to listen to their grievances if they isolated themselves gen musharraf told the bbc some people think that the women should be confined to their houses and put veils on and all that and they should not move out absolutely wrong the pakistani president was also asked whether he thought the war on terror had made the world less safe yes absolutely and i would add that unfortunately we are not addressing the core problems so therefore we can never address it in its totality he said we are fighting it in its immediate context but we are not fighting it in its strategic longterm context it is the political disputes and we need to resolve them and also the issue of illiteracy and poverty this combined are breeding grounds of extremism and terrorism on monday the pakistani president met prime minister tony blair at downing street on his first official visit to london he is due to visit the pakistani community in manchester on tuesday afternoon the mirror newspaper said on tuesday it had been handed a sensitive dossier outling the details of gen musharrafs visit to britain the paper said the document had been found in a london street by a member of the public it said the dossier contained details about his movements and also confidential police radio channels call signs and codes speaking in london on monday gen musharraf said alqaeda was on the run in pakistan but standing next to mr blair he added that it was crucial to tackle the core of what creates terrorists what creates an extremist militant environment which then leads on to terrorism that is the resolution of political disputes mr blair said the two leaders had talked about afghanistan the wider war on terror the situation in the middle east and the ongoing dispute over kashmir we agreed that in afghanistan there is some cause for optimism about the progress that has been made there said mr blair in respect of iraq we agreed that whatever the issues of the past the important thing now is to see the strategy through and ensure that iraq is capable of becoming a stable and democratic state visa row mandarin made sir john the top civil servant at the centre of the david blunkett visa affair has been knighted in the new year honours sir john gieve was home office permanent secretary during the saga which ended with mr blunkett quitting he and other civil servants were criticised for failing to recall how the visa for mr blunketts exlovers nanny came to be fasttracked the outgoing head of the troubled child support agency doug smith also earns an honour in the new years list mr smith whose retirement was announced by work and pensions secretary alan smith in november is made a commander of the order of bath both men were giving evidence to a commons committee on the computer difficulties facing the agency which left thousands of single parents without any maintenance payments when the announcement was made the knighting of sir john will be received with astonishment by opposition politicians the liberal democrats said it beggared belief he and fellow officials could not remember how leoncia casalmes application for indefinite leave to remain went from mr blunketts office to the head of the immigration and nationality department meanwhile the conservatives accused officials of a collective failure of memory but sir alan budd who led an inquiry into the affair said he had no reason to believe anyone involved had deliberately withheld information downing street defended the decision to honour both men with a spokesperson saying you have to look at their whole career sir john was made permanent secretary in april following a civil service career which dates back to he has also worked in the treasury and the department of employment a department for work and pensions spokeswoman said of mr smiths honour the award reflects all that he has achieved in a civil service career principally in the inland revenue spanning over years not just his role as chief executive of the child support agency in his career he has personally led a number of successful major change programmes mr smith is set to stay on at the csa until march less controversial will be the knighthoods for derek wanless and mike tomlinson who undertook major government reviews on health and education respectively former natwest chief executive mr wanless has delivered not one but two major reports on the nhs exchief inspector of schools mr tomlinson has recommended replacing alevels and gcses with a new diploma system in a shakeup of the exams system howard unveils election platform the conservatives would stand up for the forgotten majority michael howard pledged as he unveiled the first part of the tory election manifesto the tory leader argued there was a mass of people whom he says feel let down by tony blair and who share tory values in the foreword to the manifesto he promises to focus on restoring order trying to lower taxes and giving power back to the people labour says the document offers only a return to a failed tory past the liberal democrats say the conservatives cannot win what they predict will be a threeparty contest campaigning activity is accelerating ahead of the general election which is widely tipped for may but could be any time before june labour on monday postponed a launch of election posters because of the asian tsunami disaster mr howard published the introduction to the tory manifesto other chapters will follow in coming weeks in a speech in northamptonshire he said the forgotten majority made up the backbone of britain they were people who were saving for their first home or their retirement working hard and accepting their responsibilities he says in the manifesto foreword they have been forgotten neglected and taken for granted by mr blair saying britain must change direction mr howard argues government is too big and cannot continue down the path of ever rising taxes he promises to ensure frontline professionals parents and patients make the key decisions rather than whitehall bureaucrats and he says the tories would get a grip on crime immigration and disorder the decline of responsibility and the proliferation of socalled human rights have left us in a moral quagmire unable to get a grip on rising crime and disorder he says mr howard says he will produce a timetable for action so people can hold him to account but on issues like taxation he has so far only published options not specific plans mr howard told bbc news im determined to lower taxes but im also determined not to make any promises i cant keep the tories were unveiling material months ahead of the expected election because they needed time to make voters aware of their policies he said he was asked if tory support for the government on iraq and identity cards had given the lib dems the chance to portray themselves as the opposition to labour mr howard argued the only test for his policies was whether they were best for britain it had nothing to do with putting clear blue water between himself and his opponents labours election slogan will be britains working dont let the tories wreck it again campaign coordinator alan milburn accused the tories of launching thatcherism in instalments while labour helped the hard working majority of families lib dem president simon hughes said his party had set out its election stance in september the liberal democrats will ask the british people for support this year as the party with the policies best able to deliver freedom and fairness and to restore trust he said lawyer attacks antiterror laws a senior barrister who has resigned in protest over the governments antiterror laws says the current system is giving britain a bad name ian macdonald qc quit when the government failed to recognise a house of lords ruling that detaining terror suspects indefinitely is unlawful he was part of a strong panel who have special security clearance to act for suspected terrorists five more barristers are now reported to be threatening to resign mr macdonald told bbc news the reason why i am resigning is because i fundamentally disagree with locking people up without any trial for an indefinite period on reasonable suspicion the current legal system is certainly having a very adverse effect on the muslim community in britain and the whole asian community i think it is giving britain a bad name internationally under the antiterrorism crime and security act introduced by the government in in response to the september attacks foreign nationals suspected of involvement in terrorism who cannot be deported can be held indefinitely without trial but mr macdonald believes that detainees currently being held should be entitled to a trial by jury my own view is we need to have a full return to trial by jury a proper criminal trial with proper accusations as far as im concerned the government have to start all over again and rethink their whole strategy for dealing with this he added the attorney general lord goldsmith will receive a letter of resignation from mr macdonald on monday according to the independent his resignation is expected to be followed by those of five other barristers nicholas blake qc andrew nicol qc manjit singh gill qc rick scannell and tom de la mare they are all believed to be carefully considering their positions on the panel of special advocates who represent detainees before the special immigration appeals commission siac a secure court without a jury which tries terror suspects mr macdonald said he had no idea whether further resignations would follow but barry hugill a spokesman for the campaign group liberty told radio s today programme that more lawyers may go i can assure that there is a distinct possibilty that more lawyers may be resigning he said they are now in a situation where everything they have been trained to believe in the right to trial by jury has been abandoned and that is what gives some of them sleepless nights helena kennedy a labour peer and a human rights lawyer said the special advocates main concern was that once they had seen any special intelligence they were not allowed to speak to the detainees when this whole procedure was being considered immediately after september there was a great deal of argument particularly in the house of lords about whether there really was a process that could be considered a judicial review she said without that you are having detention with no habeus corpus and really a blot as ian mcdonald has said on our legal landscape something really quite shocking with regard to the rule of the law turkey deal to help world peace a deal bringing turkey a step closer to eu membership is of fundamental importance to the peace and security of the world tony blair has said the deal struck at the european council last week also proved claims of a clash between muslims and christians were wrong mr blair said it represented the achievement of an historic british objective he added tory leader michael howard said the deal laid to rest any suggestion the eu was antiislamic turkeys involvement with the eu would provide an invaluable bridge between europe and the rest of the world mr howard added but the tory leader argued that the eu constitution was not designed to take in a country as large as turkey mr blair has been a leading advocate of turkish membership despite controversy surrounding the idea he insisted that the turkish leadership had made great advances in improving its human rights records the deal to open formal talks with ankara came despite an eu demand for turkey to recognise cyprus it was agreed the issue can be tackled at a later date but turkish premier recep erdogan had to accept negotiations did not guarantee his country full eu membership the internationally recognised southern part of cyprus is an eu member but turkey which occupies northern cyprus had previously insisted it would not bow to demands to recognise the country calling the issue a red line it could take up to years before turkey is able to join and entry cannot be guaranteed if it joins turkey may have to accept restrictions to limit migration by its citizens the eu has also announced that it will start accession talks with croatia in april however talks will begin only if the country cooperates fully with the un war crimes tribunal for the former yugoslavia protect whistleblowers tuc says the government should change the law to give more protection to employees who raise health and safety concerns about their workplaces the tuc has said it said data from employment tribunals suggested safety whistleblowers had lost their jobs since some firms found it cheaper to sack a worker than to improve buildings or change working conditions it said the health and safety executive said it was trying to get workers more involved in helping to make workplaces safer the tuc figures were drawn from unfair dismissal cases at tribunals were health and safety were the main issue safety representatives were often ignored when raising concerns because there was no legal duty to respond claimed the union organisation general secretary brendan barber said it shouldnt be a firing offence to object to unsafe work workers should not be placed in the situation where they are forced to choose between risking their job or risking their personal health and safety mr barber who said the problem is far worse than official statistics show called for a legal system that protects safety whistleblowers he added that workers who are not in a union as well as casual and migrant workers stand little chance of redress rory o neill editor of unionbacked hazards magazine which conducted the research said giving union safety reps more rights in more workplaces is the ultimate winwin death and injuries at work increased last year for the second time since the turn of the century it would be a fatal mistake not to take full advantage of the union safety effect the tuc has called on the government to appoint roving safety reps and to increase spending on health and safety work inspections the health and safety executive had said that it had launched an initiative to make factories and offices safer with more worker involvement kinnock to urge reform in lords neil kinnock has said his acceptance of a seat in the house of lords will allow him to help achieve further progress with substantial democratic reform on the bbcs breakfast with frost it was put to mr kinnock that he had once referred to lords members as brigands muggers bribers and gangsters but the outgoing european commissioner said his comments made some years ago needed to be put in context he said advocates for reform needed to be inside the lords to vote for it it was pointed out to me that if the additional democratic reform is going to take place it is going to require advocates in the lords and people there willing to vote for it mr kinnock added that the second factor behind his acceptance of the peerage was his appointment as chairman of the british council history demonstrates that its immensely useful for the british council to have its chairman in the house of lords and that was a conclusive factor mr kinnock said he thought about the decision for quite a long time because he had long had reservations about the lords but he added the process of reform has developed substantially but not sufficiently and consequently i did take all these factors into consideration because its not a decision to be made glibly the former labour leader said he would probably take the title of lord kinnock of bedwellty his first constituency for which he was selected in mcconnell details scots wave toll at least three people from scotland died in the tsunami disaster and a further three are on the missing list the first minister has told msps the figures came out during a statement by jack mcconnell to the scottish parliament on wednesday he formally expressed scotlands sympathy for the victims of the indian ocean tidal wave which killed mr mcconnell went on to promise that scotland would play its part in the reconstruction effort he said the provisional figures on the dead and lost had been provided by the police mr mcconnell said the tragedy should persuade everyone to step up the fight against global poverty and change the world for the better he said he was proud of the generous response of people in scotland to the disaster appeal which is expected soon to top m the first minister also praised scottish water for immediately flying bottled water and five large generators to the disaster zone the scottish executive has seconded staff to the aid agencies but he said scotland was in it for the long term with help planned for fishing communities for childrens services and for the aid charities he said must be the year that scotland showed clearly it cared for what happened to people elsewhere in the world whether in asia or in africa mr mcconnell went on to signal that the executive would play its part in the make poverty history campaign being mounted by a variety of aid charities trade unions and churches in the runup to the g summit in gleneagles in july edinburgh architect dominic stephenson became the first scot to be confirmed as a victim of the asian tsunami the yearold was holidaying on the thai island of koh phi phi with eileen lee she is still missing police urge pub closure power new powers are needed to close disorderly pubs bars and clubs for up to a week or even permanently police chiefs have told mps association of chief police officers president chris fox said the current hour closure power did not have enough impact on bad landlords mr foxs comments follow the controversy over plans to allow pubs to open around the clock he rejected critics calls for the law change to be delayed instead the new licensing act could help reduce drunken disorder but only if it was properly planned he argued acpo made its call for stronger closure powers in a paper for the commons home affairs select committee after the meeting mr fox said being able to close premises for only hours did not necessarily make an impact if its on a saturday morning and you close for hours theres not a lot of pain for the premises because they probably wouldnt open on sunday anyway this is about getting through to the management that they cant run a disorderly house without facing some immediate sanctions under acpos proposal the closure orders would be used only with the agreement of the local licensing authority the new licensing laws will give police greater powers to close pubs and clubs but only for hour periods mr fox said the drinks industry was currently not regulating itself its making money at the cost of human misery and the public purse and the strategic planning process has been less than useless he said mr fox said the new laws due to start being phased in next month could help if food outlets public transport and public toilets could cope with latenight drinkers staggering it closing hours will be a solution if the infrastructure is there if the premises are properly managed and people arent being served rolling drunk and underage and then tossed out into the street he said we have the problem from pm to am in any event we have to get a grip on the underlying causes of this acpo wants pubs and clubs which cause extra work for police and hospitals to have to pay towards the costs home secretary charles clarke is currently looking at the idea of a levy on the drinks industry to pay for the cost of extra policing the licensing changes have sparked concern among some mps councils and some senior police officers who fear they could exacerbate drinking problems culture secretary tessa jowell on tuesday said it was not her job to bow to the campaign against the changes it was the status quo not the new laws which were causing current binge drinking problems she told bbc twos newsnight leaked documents have suggested exhome secretary david blunkett branded new opening hours as a leap in the dark but ms jowell insisted his concerns had been met the polices job against alcoholrelated crime would be made easier if all pubs did not close at the same time she added blunkett tells of love and pain david blunkett has spoken of his love for married publisher kimberly quinn for the first time the home secretary described how it affected his friends and personal life but said he was a great believer in personal responsibility mr blunkett is taking legal action to gain access to mrs quinns twoyearold son she denies he is mr blunketts the interview with bbc radio sheffield was made before allegations he fasttracked a visa for mrs quinns nanny the allegations which he has denied are being investigated by sir alan budd mr blunkett talked about how he fell in love but that she resisted his desire to go public in an apparent reference to his court action to gain access to her son he says he was a great believer in responsibility and consequences even when they were painful mr blunkett told bbc radio sheffield i fell in love with someone and they wouldnt go public and things started to go very badly wrong in the summer and then the news of the world picked up the story i tried for three years to make something work i havent spoken about it and i dont intend to even in the biography thats being written about me ive ensured that theres as little as possible bbc political correspondent carole walker said the timing of the broadcast was unlikely to help his efforts to show that he is concentrating on getting on with the job of home secretary shadow home secretary david davis says mr blunkett should quit if he is found to have influenced the visa process even indirectly reports have claimed mr blunkett chaired a meeting to discuss delays in the visa system after he learned of nanny leoncia casalmes wait the home office has said it would be up to sir alans inquiry to decide if any such meeting was relevant home office minister fiona mactaggart said she hoped mr blunkett would survive in his job i work with him every day and i have always been surprised by how focused he is on the job in hand on working to deal with things she said she told bbc ones breakfast with frost programme he is just really down for the job and i hope he does survive mps murder sentence concern murder sentences should not be reduced automatically simply because of a guilty plea says a new mps report the influential commons home affairs committee was responding to sentencing guidelines issued this summer the mps also call for tougher sentences for crimes committed under the influence of drink or drugs they say the influence of drugs and alcohol should be introduced as an aggravating factor when judges and magistrates sentence offenders committee chairman john denham said drugs of alcohol were sometimes used as an excuse the committee believes that these arguments should be rejected by sentencers and that being under their influence should instead be an aggravating factor at present judges when sentencing murderers to the mandatory life sentence can reduce the tariff the minimum term they must serve if the defendant pleads guilty but although they are spared the ordeal of a trial many murder victims relatives are unhappy in july this year amanda champions killer james ford pleaded guilty to her murder and was jailed for at least years it would have been longer had he denied the charge amandas uncle lewis champion told the bbc news website ford did not deserve any credit for his plea saying nothing at all is worth taking five years off a murder sentence mps criticised home secretary david blunkett last year for introducing lastminute rules allowing reduced sentences for murderers who pleaded guilty the measures passed into law virtually unnoticed after mr blunkett introduced them at a late stage of the criminal justice bill as a result says the committee the government may need to relegislate to remove ambiguity over how murderers should be sentenced it is also calling on the senior judge in england and wales lord woolf to abandon draft guidelines he proposed in september to reduce sentences of murderers who plead guilty the committee said the plans had not reflected the public disquiet expressed over the possibility of significantly reduced prison terms for murderers lord woolfs sentencing guidelines council sgc caused further controversy by suggesting a one third discount off sentences for early guilty pleas in all types of crime as a result murderers who face a year tariff could get five years knocked off if they give themselves up to the police mr denham believes the sgc should reconsider its proposals to reflect parliaments wish that murder should be treated as a separate and especially grave category of offence he said we want to see sentencers advised that in the case of murder reduction in sentence for a guilty plea should not normally be granted in addition to reductions for other mitigating circumstances but a spokesman for the home office defended the proposals he said by making express provision for murder tariffs in the criminal justice act parliament sent a clear signal that it expects murder to be treated differently to other offences we stand by the provisions in the act that cover guilty plea discounts which have potential benefits for victims and witnesses of avoiding the trauma of a trial shadow home secretary david davis echoed criticisms of the way mr blunkett introduced the murder tariff rules there is genuine concern about potential reductions in murder sentences such action sends out the wrong signals to violent criminals and completely undermines the governments claim to be tough on crime he said but liberal democrat spokesman mark oaten warned the mps committee that binding judges too much might look like political interference the danger of having a prescriptive approach is that whilst every murder is awful it is also different he told bbc news noone can define new hunt ban the new law banning hunting with dogs is so poorly drafted noone can define the offence prohunt mps say the accusation came after it emerged a devon man had been told he could use his four dogs to chase away unwanted animals from his farm because he did not intend to kill deer or foxes it was not hunting lib dem mp lembit opik said ministers had invented a new category of hunting chasing away and asked how police were supposed to interpret the rules north devon landowner giles bradshaw was put in touch with the middle way group of which mr opik is a cochairman after he had been in contact with the rural affairs ministry defra he had asked whether his technique of using his four dogs to frighten off deer and foxes would be outlawed under the hunting act mr bradshaw was initially told it was an offence prompting him to complain the middle way group also said mr bradshaw would be put in a position where he would have to buy a rifle to shoot animals that would have previously gone free in a later conversation mr bradshaw was told that according to defras lawyers chasing away unwanted animals was not in fact hunting as described in the hunting act therefore you would not be committing an offence mr opik said hunting with dogs and flushing are not defined in the hunting act now defra have also invented a completely new category of hunting chasing away which isnt even covered by the act however all these activities involve the use of dogs to chase wild mammals how is the village bobby who sees a group of people with dogs supposed to distinguish between illegal hunting exempt hunting drag hunting unintentional hunting a hunt exercising hounds or simply chasing away tory mp peter luff another cochairman of middle way said that the legislation was so poorly drafted nobody appears able to properly define the offence it is no wonder the government desperately wants to move on from this disastrous law however i seriously doubt the countryside will be that accommodating mike hobday of the league against cruel sports said there is no confusion it is a matter of simple common sense if mr bradshaw is setting his dogs to chase wild animals then he is hunting them and that will be a criminal offence if all the dogs are doing is barking at the deer then nobody can define that as hunting faith schools citizenship warning schools must improve the quality of citizenship lessons or social cohesion and democracy will suffer says the education watchdog independent faith schools were singled out by ofsted chief david bell for not doing enough to promote the wider tenets of british society mr bell said muslim jewish and evangelical christian schools must be intolerant of intolerance diversity certainly must not mean segregated or separate he said mr bells speech called for a much greater effort in all types of schools to teach citizenship with an accompanying survey showing that young people knew little about politics and had no enthusiasm to find out more badlytaught citizenship lessons have previously been criticised by mr bell and in a speech to the hansard society he warned that it was failing to pass on an understanding of democracy public service and shared values he highlighted his particular concern for citizenship in the growing number of independent faith schools which he said included about muslim evangelical christian and jewish schools mr bell expressed concern about schools which did not teach children enough about a common heritage and needed to do more to promote principles of mutual tolerance and social inclusion i worry that many young people are being educated in faithbased schools with little appreciation of their wider responsibilities and obligations to british society said mr bell the ofsted chief said his forthcoming annual report would make particular reference to muslim schools many must adapt their curriculum to ensure that it provides pupils with a broad general knowledge of public institutions and services in england and helps them to acquire an appreciation of and respect for other cultures in a way that promotes tolerance and harmony mr bell said such questions of religion and cultural identity were tricky issues but he argued that we must not allow our recognition of diversity to become apathy in the face of any challenge to our coherence as a nation i would go further and say that an awareness of our common heritage as british citizens equal under the law should enable us to assert with confidence that we are intolerant of intolerance illiberalism and attitudes and values that demean the place of certain sections of our community be they women or people living in nontraditional relationships said mr bell ministers lose slopping out case the scottish executive has lost an appeal against an inmates compensation for being forced to slop out in prison armed robber robert napier won after he claimed he suffered an outbreak of the skin complaint eczema when slopping out at barlinnie prison napier said that the practice where prisoners use buckets in their cells as toilets breached his human rights on thursday the court of session threw out a move by the executive to apply a more rigorous standard of proof the executive faces more than similar claims for damages from prisoners and former inmates more than actions have already been raised in the court of session and sheriff courts in scotland an executive spokesman said we will study this judgement in detail much has changed to address the issues raised in the napier case for example slopping out has ended at barlinnie and work in other prisons is being accelerated todays judgement does not affect the outcome of other cases napier a remand prisoner at the time raised a legal challenge in under the european convention on human rights in which he sought he was awarded compensation last april after winning his case executive ministers raised an appeal arguing that the standard of proof to be applied in cases alleging a breach of the european convention on human rights through degrading and inhumane treatment should be beyond reasonable doubt this is the standard normally applied in criminal trials in scotland however civil litigation is settled on the test of a balance of probabilities judge lord cullen sitting with lord osborne and lord hamilton ruled that alleged human rights breaches involving degrading treatment should be dealt with on the normal civil standard napiers lawyer tony kelly believes the action will soon be followed by others mr kelly said there are hundreds of people still undergoing slopping out overcrowding and poor regime and those people will certainly be heartened by todays judgement scottish national party justice minister kenny macaskill said that the slopping out case had been a fiasco from start to finish he said ministers were fully aware of the state of scotlands jails funds were available but they chose to ignore the problem and after this ruling i suspect we will be faced with even more claims and no doubt more payouts a short term executive saving has resulted in a long term public cost escaped prisoner report ordered first minister jack mcconnell has ordered a report on the decision to allow a paranoid schizophrenic knife attacker to go on a visit unguarded michael ferguson escaped after being allowed out of the highsecurity carstairs unit the snps nicola sturgeon has demanded to know who was responsible for signing off the leave the scottish executive said ministers would be notified but it would not be common practice to sign approval an executive spokesman said the health department and the state hospital itself would work together on preparing the report ministerial responsibility for carstairs rests with rhona brankin the deputy health minister ms brankin said the first minister has called for a review of what has happened we need to talk to the state hospital and we need to reflect on this ms sturgeon has written to mr mcconnell asking for clarification on the move to allow the prisoner out she said questions must be answered about his escape if the public is to be reassured about safety police are still searching for ferguson who failed to return after a trip to east kilbride on monday the scottish national partys parliamentary leader argued that under the law authorisation of fergusons leave of absence would have come directly from ministers she said the scottish executive seemed to indicate yesterday that the escape of mr ferguson was a matter for carstairs however my understanding is that under the mental health legislation the decision to grant this patient and any restricted patient leave of absence would have required direct and specific authorisation by scottish ministers she added i have written to the first minister today asking for confirmation of that fact i have also asked him to confirm which minister would routinely take decisions of this nature and what information they are based on this is not an attempt to apportion blame but to ensure a better understanding of the decision making process in such important and sensitive cases police said ferguson posed a danger to the public bbc scotland political correspondent glenn campbell said the first minister had ordered an urgent report into the situation he said we understand from the executive that in this case no individual minister signed off the approval for michael ferguson to be released unescorted from carstairs the executive concedes that it is up to scottish ministers they have a legal responsibility for approving this sort of leave but they say routinely it is specialised officials that make that decision and simply inform ministers that they have taken it but at that stage presumably ministers can ask hard questions and can ask for reassurances that the patient is not a serious danger to the public or that any risk has been minimised scottish conservative leader david mcletchie said earlier it was almost beyond belief that this has been allowed to happen the executive spokeswoman said the recommendation for leave was agreed by a psychiatric advisor in conjunction with officials on behalf of ministers she said ministers were told of that notified of it but it would not be common practice for them to sign it off they do have statutory responsibility but the common practice has been that people who work with the patient and have the best knowledge about risk would make that decision ferguson who slashed a man in a doctors surgery in coatbridge in had been out to see his fiance annabella holmes whom he met when she was a patient at the high security complex in south lanarkshire he is described as being ft ins tall slim with blond hair blue eyes and a fair complexion ferguson was wearing a black jacket grey jeans black jumper and black shoes when he was last seen he has multiple fading tattoos on his left hand and a very faded tear tattoo under his left eye ms holmes is not missing but there have been no sightings of ferguson since monday strathclyde police asked anyone who spots ferguson to contact sergeant keith mcdonald on chancellor rallies labour voters gordon brown has issued a rallying cry telling supporters the stakes are too high to stay at home or protest vote in the forthcoming general election the chancellor said the vote expected to fall on may will give a clear and fundamental choice between labour investment and conservative cuts speaking at labours spring conference in gateshead mr brown claimed the nhs was not safe in conservative hands he said tory plans to cut bn tax would cut deep into public service to a packed audience at gatesheads sage centre the chancellor said the cuts proposed by shadow chancellor oliver letwin were the equivalent of sacking every teacher gp and nurse in the country he told activists laying into the conservatives record in government he said i give you this promise with labour britain will never return to the mistakes of erm and inflation interest rates bn in lost reserves repossessed one million in negative equity and three million unemployed never again tory boom and bust this will be the central dividing line at the election between a conservative party taking britain back and planning deep cuts of bn in our services and a labour government taking britain forward which on a platform of stability will reform and renew our hospitals schools and public services and i am proud to say spend by bn more turning to the economy the chancellor pledged to continue economic stability and growth in a third term in power he said after seven years labour had transformed from a party not trusted with the economy to the only party trusted with the economy it was now a party not just of employees but of employers and managers he said in the speech which prompted a standing ovation from an audience clearly warm to mr brown he also promised to end teenage unemployment within the next five years he also highlighted plans for debt relief for the worlds poorest countries a national minimum wage for and yearolds and the creation of a network of childrens centres and flexibility in maternity leave the prime minister is to take part later on saturday in an interactive question and answer session fielding queries sent in by email text message and telephone as part of labours attempt to engage the public in their campaign councils must find gypsy sites ministers are telling councils to find more sites for travellers amid continuing rows concerning a string of unauthorised encampments councils are also to be given stronger powers to move on illegal settlements by gypsy communities on rural land more money is to be given to councils to develop official caravan parks said housing minister yvette cooper in november mps urged ministers to make councils create sites because travellers have no place to stop ms cooper said an annual scheme to refurbish existing traveller sites would now be extended to consider council bids for new stopping places that scheme has paid out m in four years with m available for there are two major problems in the planning system at the moment concerning gypsy and traveller sites said ms cooper firstly local authorities are not identifying enough appropriate locations either for private or public sites and secondly they do not have enough powers to deal swiftly with development on inappropriate sites the result is that there are too many developments on inappropriate sites causing tensions and difficulties for both the neighbouring communities and the gypsies and travellers that is why we are consulting on a new obligation on local authorities to identify more appropriate sites as well as new powers to take immediate action if the development is in the wrong place and cannot be tolerated in even the shortterm because of risk to local amenity and the environment under the new regulations expected to be in force in the spring officials will be able to serve temporary stop notices aimed at preventing works on a site before a council has had chance to obtain a full legal ban many mps with rural constituencies particularly in eastern england have been pressing the government to create stronger enforcement powers saying villagers are suffering because of the legal delays in removing illegal encampments andrew ryder of the traveller law reform coalition said we welcome talk about an obligation on councils to identify land for gypsies and travellers so long as it is a real obligation as opposed to a recommendation which could be and was easily ignored new accommodation proposals for travellers need to be backed up with decent funding and intervention by the government when councils attempt to dodge their responsibilities towards travellers as they often do living on the side of the road or being worn down by planning appeals legal action and eviction is no ones idea of fun in their november report mps from the committee scrutinising the office for the deputy prime minister responsible for housing said most illegal traveller encampments were caused by a lack of places to stop numerous communities and councils were paying for lengthy and expensive evictions against travelling communities said the mps in turn the problems had worsened because councils were reluctant to voluntarily provide sites because of resistance from residents two of the most controversial traveller sites cottenham in cambridgeshire and minety in wiltshire remain embroiled in an ongoing legal battle plaid mps cottage arson claim a plaid cymru mp believes uk security services were involved in some arson attacks blamed on welsh extremists it is years since the start of years of firebombings attributed to a shadowy group known as meibion glyndwr plaid cymrus elfyn llwyd has suggested the security services could have been involved with the intention of discrediting the nationalist vote exwelsh office minister lord roberts of conwy denied security services were involved in march this year north wales police reopened the case saying materials kept during their investigations would be examined to find whether it would yield dna evidence meibion glyndwr which means sons of glyndwr began burning property in december in protest at homes in rural wales being sold as holiday cottages to people from england the group was linked to most of the or so firebombing incidents stretching from the llyn peninsula to pembrokeshire the campaign continued until the early s police were accused in some quarters of targeting anyone who was a nationalist although one man sion aubrey roberts was convicted in of sending letter bombs in the post the arson cases remain unsolved as a solicitor elfyn llwyd represented welsh singer bryn fn when he was arrested on suspicion of being involved in the arson campaign fn was released without charge but now as mp for merionnydd nant conwy and plaid cymrus parliamentary leader mr llwyd has argued that some of the terror attacks may have had the involvement of the security services and not meibion glyndwr he believes that elements of the british security services may have carried out renegade actions in order to discredit plaid cymru and the nationalist vote ahead of elections the claim is made in an interview for bbc wales maniffesto programme to be shown on sc on sunday mr llwyd said that the sophistication of many of the devices used in the attacks compared to the crude nature of many others suggests a degree of professionalism which could only have come from individuals who knew exactly what they were doing he said what im saying is that the role that they took wasnt the appropriate one ie like an agent provocateur and perhaps interfering and creating a situation where it looked like it was the nationalists that were responsible the programme also heard from lord roberts of conwy who was a welsh office minister at the time he denied that the security services played any improper role mr llwyds theory has also been questioned by plaid cymrus former president dafydd wigley he accepted that the fires damaged plaid cymrus public image but believed that the security services had their hands full at the time with the ira and animal rights activists maniffesto can be seen on sc on sunday december at gmt hatfield executives go on trial engineering firm balfour beatty and five railway managers are to go on trial for manslaughter over the hatfield rail crash in four people died when a section of rail broke and a high speed train derailed balfour beattys railway maintenance arm was in charge of the upkeep of the line at hatfield hertfordshire balfour beatty managers anthony walker and nicholas jeffries and railtrack managers

corporate manslaughter charge it is expected the trial could last as long as a year the accident on october happened when the london to leeds express came off the tracks at mph when it was derailed by a cracked section of rail the accident on the east coast main line sparked major disruption the overall responsibility for the line was railtracks the company that has now become network rail those

rebuts charade claims concessions on a bill which critics claim would allow euthanasia through the back door were not a political ploy the lord chancellor has said ministers have been accused of panic in offering last minute changes to the mental capacity bill amid chaotic scenes in the commons on tuesday lord falconer said it was fair to criticise the late timing of the offer he said the changes provided a solution to a very difficult issue but some mps argue the situation is still unclear the bill allows people to give somebody the power of attorney to make decisions on their behalf if they become too ill to decide for themselves ministers insist the plans would not change laws on euthanasia and would improve safeguards critics fear it could allow killing by omission through withdrawing treatment including food and fluids tony blair said he would do everything he could to meet concerns about the bill but changes to the bill must not overturn the law set when a court ruled that doctors could withdraw artificial feeding and hydration from hillsborough coma victim tony bland it is important we dont end up in the situation where doctors and consultants are confused about the law and may lay themselves open to prosecution in circumstances where no sensible person would want that to happen he said on tuesday the government saw off a backbench attempt to force changes to the bill by votes to despite rebellion by labour mps the revolt was also reduced by news that lord falconer had promised the catholic archbishop of cardiff to strengthen safeguards in the bill but that only came after mps bombarded constitutional affairs minister david lammy with a barrage of requests for him to read the letter as they complained they had been left in the dark eventually he was hurriedly handed the letter to read out five minutes before the crunch votes prompting claims of a shambles the deputy speaker later said the debate had not been handled as it should have been lord falconer says there will be amendments when the bill goes to the house of lords he told bbc news we have given a commitment to put into the bill a clause that says that nothing in the bill authorises any act where the motive of the person authorising the decision is to end life the motive has got to be to end suffering he denied the concessions were a political manoeuvre forced by panic about the rebellion it was inevitable that minds became more focused as the bill went through parliament but the result was a sensible solution he said i dont think it is something to be embarrassed about these issues are not easy to deal with he went on bbc political editor andrew marr said mr lammy was waste deep in quicksand and sinking fast after his performance but lord falconer praised his minister for an excellent job former conservative leader iain duncan smith one of the chief critics of the plans condemned the debate as a charade and complained the promises of changes to the bill were vague antiterror plan faces first test plans to allow home secretary charles clarke to place terror suspects under house arrest without trial are set for their first real test in parliament tories lib dems and some labour mps are poised to vote against the plans mr clarke says the powers are needed to counter terror threats opponents say only judges not politicians should be able to order detention of uk citizens the government is expected to win wednesdays vote in the commons but faces a battle in the house of lords the prevention of terrorism bill was published on tuesday it proposes control orders which would mean house arrest in the most serious cases and curfews electronic tagging and limits on telephone and internet access for other suspects the two opposition parties are particularly worried that the control orders would initially be imposed on the sayso of the home secretary rather than a judge tory shadow home secretary david davis warned of the potential for miscarriages of justice like the guildford four for which tony blair recently apologised as a result of the pressure on politicians to lock up terror suspects those pressures would be much more for a politician than they would on a judge and thats why we have serious concerns abut that approach he told bbc radio s today programme mr clarke says he does not intend to use the house arrest powers now even for the current terror detainees he also said that any decision he made would be reviewed by a judge within seven days the foreign terror suspects currently detained are mostly held at londons belmarsh prison they are held under laws which the law lords have ruled break human rights rules and which are due to expire on march the new powers designed to replace the existing laws and meet the law lords concerns would apply to british as well as foreign terror suspects critics say that giving politicians the power to deprive uk citizens of their freedom is the biggest attack on civil liberties for years opposition mps are also angry they will have only two days wednesday and next monday to debate the new plans before they pass to the house of lords but the government says the existing powers run out soon so must be replaced urgently in a rare move the tories and lib dems have jointly tabled a motion opposing the new bill saying the house arrest plans are excessive it argues decisions should be taken on a higher standard of proof and the plan wrongly infringes the right to liberty by failing to bring terrorists to trial where there is evidence mr davis told today it gives a minister for the first time in modern history the right to detain without trial without showing the evidence and indeed in some respects almost the allegation against the individual concerned he questioned why there was such a rush to introduce the legislation when mr clarke had indicated he was not planning to use the house arrest powers straight away liberal democrat home affairs spokesman mark oaten said we believe it should be the judge that takes decisions not politicians mr clarke said the security services and police backed his measures and it would be rash and negligent to ignore their advice nobody should doubt that terrorists at home and abroad wanted to attack the uk and its interests he argued blair rejects iraq advice calls tony blair has rejected calls for the publication of advice on the legality of the iraq war amid growing calls for an investigation the prime minister told his monthly press conference the matter had been dealt with by the attorney general earlier conservative mp michael mates joined calls for a probe into claims lord goldsmiths statement to parliament was drawn up at number mr blair said the statement was a fair summary of lord goldsmiths opinion thats what he lord goldsmith said and thats what i say he has dealt with this time and time and time again mr blair told his monthly news conference in downing street he refused to answer further questions on the issue saying it had been dealt with literally scores of times and the position has not changed lord goldsmith has denied being leaned on and says the words written were his the government refuses to publish his advice on the legality of the war saying such papers have always been kept confidential mr mates who is a member of the commons intelligence and security committee and was part of the butler inquiry into prewar intelligence told the bbc on friday that as a general rule is right but its not an absolute rule he said there had been other occasions when advice had been published most recently regarding prince charless marriage plans the government could not pick and choose when to use the convention he said mr mates added we discovered that there were two or three occasions in the past when law officers advice to the government has been published and this may be one of those special occasions when it would be in the public interest to see the advice which the attorney general gave to the prime minister this is argument was rejected by mr blair who said firstly we havent broken the precedent and secondly peter goldsmith has made his statement and i have got absolutely nothing to add to it in a book published this week philippe sands qc a member of cherie blairs matrix chambers says lord goldsmith warned tony blair on march that the iraq war could be illegal without a second un resolution sanctioning military action but a short statement about lord goldsmiths position was presented in a written parliamentary answer on march just before a crucial commons vote on the military action mr sands book suggests it was actually written by home office minister lord falconer and downing street adviser baroness morgan former minister clare short who resigned from the government over the iraq war said it was the same statement that was earlier shown to the cabinet as it discussed military action she told the bbc the full advice should have been attached according to the ministerial code my view is we need the house of lords to set up a special committee summon the attorney get all the papers out look at exactly what happened she said the conservatives and liberal democrats say they want the publication of the full legal advice given by the attorney general on thursday lord goldsmith said his statement had not been written by or at number in my parliamentary answer on march i explained my genuinely held independent view that military action was lawful under the existing security council resolutions he said police probe bnp mosque leaflet police are investigating a british national party leaflet posted to homes in south wales opposing plans for a new mosque antiracism campaigners in swansea have handed copies to south wales police swanseas muslim community is raising money to open a new mosque and community centre in the former st andrews united reform church the building on george street has been derelict since the s taha idris director of the swansea bay race equality council said his organisation contacted police after receiving complaints from the public im quite shocked to see this sort of leaflet by the bnp in swansea he said the bnp has tried in the past to get into swansea and this is another example of them trying again i am in no doubt that the bnp are not needed and not wanted here a south wales police spokeswoman confirmed that they were looking at the contents of the leaflet according to the bnps website they have been posted to homes in the castle ward the bnp website carries a photograph of party leader nick griffin who lives near welshpool mid wales delivering the leaflet the bnp has denied it is trying to stir up hatred of any race or religion but argues that they should be able to debate this without fear of arrest swansea unite against fascism uaf is meeting this week to plan a campaign following the death earlier this year of kalan kawa karim an iraqi kurd living in swansea it organised an antiracism march in the city that was supported by more than people it is planning its own mail shot campaign and may launch a petition in support of the plans for the mosque andy richards of swansea uaf said the leaflet was exactly what he had come to expect from the bnp the people of swansea will not put up with this swanseas muslim community bought the former church just across the road from the existing mosque on st helens road in the late s mr idris said the community was now raising money to renovate the building it is a landmark building in swansea and would otherwise just crumble he said it is the ideal opportunity for the building to be restored and used in the proper manner it will be a muslim community centre its a holistic place used for education weddings deaths and births he said space was limited in the current mosque and on some occasions muslims had to travel to llanelli for cultural events jowell confirms casino climbdown tessa jowell has announced plans to limit the number of new casinos in the uk to in a move branded a humiliating retreat by the tories it puts an end to plans for up to super casinos originally outlined in the governments gambling bill instead there will be a cap of eight new casinos in each size category small medium and large the culture secretary said the move showed she listened to critics who feared an explosion in gambling but conservative shadow culture secretary john whittingdale said the way the government had handled the bill was a shambles this announcement is a further humiliating retreat by the government instead of the initial intention of the gambling bill to liberalise the rules governing gambling the bill now imposes a more restrictive regime than exists at present shares in british casino operators london clubs international rank group and stanley leisure who had been hoping the bill would pave the way for a big expansion in smaller casinos fell by between and following the announcement ms jowells deputy richard caborn said the government had adopted a cautious approach to the issue and responded to the concerns raised limiting the number of regional casinos to eight in the first phase is a cautious move that will allow us to test the impact of a new kind of casino on the levels of problem gambling he said we also believe its right to apply this same level of caution to small and large casinos he added that local authorities would still be able to stop new casinos coming to their areas church groups welcomed the limit on the number of casinos salvation army spokesman jonathan lomax said the proliferation of these casinos on high streets across the country was a real concern and the three year trial period which we think should last at least five years will enable research into the potentially severe social consequences of an increase in hard and addictive forms of gambling but british british casino association chairman penny cobham said her members were outraged by the decision which followed a campaign in the daily mail newspaper there was never going to be a massive explosion of casinos talk of a casino on every high street was just a scaring tactic security papers found in street an inquiry is under way after files containing security details about the pakistani presidents visit to london were found by a member of the public the files are believed to contain detailed security arrangements for gen pervez musharrafs visit this week including police codes scotland yard said the policing operation had been reviewed a spokesman said president musharrafs safety had not been compromised as the papers had been handed in promptly we cannot discuss who was responsible for the documents only that they contained the policing arrangements for the official visit said the spokesman the papers are believed to have been found by a member of the public in a street in mayfair and given to the mirror newspaper the police spokesman said the newspaper handed the report over on monday the forces directorate of professional standards is investigating the circumstances surrounding the loss of the documents he said gen musharraf held talks with tony blair on monday he arrived in britain on sunday night after flying from the united states where he met president george w bush he is due to visit the pakistani community in manchester on tuesday afternoon blair congratulates bush on win tony blair has said he looks forward to continuing his strong relationship with george bush and working with him during his second term as president mr bushs reelection came at a crucial time for a world that was fractured divided and uncertain mr blair said it had to be brought together he added saying action was needed on poverty the middle east and the conditions on which terrorists prey mr blair said states had to work with the us to fight global terrorism but there was a need to recognise it would not be defeated by military might alone but also by demonstrating the strength of our common values he added solving the conflict in the middle east was the worlds single most pressing political challenge of the present day mr blair warned the prime minister also urged europe and the us to build anew their alliance all of us in positions of leadership not just president bush have a responsibility to rise to this challenge it is urgent that we do so mr blair also paid tribute to democrat john kerrys campaign saying he had helped make the presidential election a true celebration of american democracy the election of the us president was significant for the world but particularly so for britain because of its special relationship he added earlier tory leader michael howard sent mr bush his warmest congratulations saying we look to the president to be a unifying force for those all over the world who share our determination to defend freedom liberal democrat leader charles kennedy welcomed the fact there had been a quick conclusion to the election unlike in mr bushs first task was to rebuild a sense of domestic purpose within the us he said mr kennedy said internationally it is to be hoped that a second term will see a more sensitive approach to relations with longstanding allies not least for the global efforts to combat terrorism lib dem foreign affairs spokesman menzies campbell said a win by mr kerry would have given mr blair the chance of a fresh start adding it was almost as if there was an umbilical cord between mr bush and the uk premier europeans must hope that his administration will be much more multilateral in character and that he will act swiftly to rebuild the atlantic partnership which is so vital to security iraq will remain an issue of potential division for some time to come even before the result became clear mr blair was being urged to push for action on climate change at his first meeting with whichever candidate won liberal democrat environment spokesman norman baker underlined the issue of global warming during a commons debate on angloamerican relations on wednesday environment secretary margaret beckett has said the us will act on global warming despite george bushs refusal to sign up to the kyoto protocol on carbon emissions public opinion would force change she told bbc news but myron ebell an adviser on climate change to president bush has said there would be no change in the us stance and rejected the threat of climate change he claimed the us was the only country with independent scientists howard truanted to play snooker conservative leader michael howard has admitted he used to play truant to spend time with his school friends at a snooker hall mr howard said his time at jacks snooker hall in llanelli in the s had not done him any lasting damage but he told the times educational supplement that truancy was very bad and said firm action was needed mr howard also called for a return to olevels and more classroom discipline mr howard eventually left llanelli grammar school and the snooker hall to go to cambridge university he said i dont think its done me any lasting damage nor has it made me a snooker world champion there might have been some occasions when we left early of an afternoon im just being honest i think truancy is a very bad thing and that firm action should be taken to deal with it another player who has failed to win snookers world championship jimmy the whirlwind white has previously admitted missing lessons instead spending his days in smoky halls tony meo another player and me used to spend all of our spare time there mr white said we loved the game and the atmosphere school went out of the window i went for a while and then started taking time off mr howards fellow welshman ray reardon known by his fellow professionals as dracula won the snooker world championship six times having left school at to work as a miner and terry griffiths like mr howard from llanelli won the tournament in it is not known whether the two of them ever clashed cues at jacks short attacks us over tsunami aid former cabinet minister clare short has criticised the usled tsunami aid coalition saying the un should be leading efforts president bush has announced that an alliance of the us india australia and japan will coordinate a humanitarian drive but ms short said the effect of the parallel coalition would be to undermine the un she said only the un had the moral authority to lead the relief work ms short resigned as international development secretary over the iraq war i think this initiative from america to set up four countries claiming to coordinate sounds like yet another attempt to undermine the un when it is the best system we have got and the one that needs building up she said only really the un can do that job she told bbc radio fours pm programme it is the only body that has the moral authority but it can only do it well if it is backed up by the authority of the great powers ms short said the countries involved could not boast good records on their response to major disasters the us was very bad at coordinating with anyone and india had its own problems ms short said i dont know what that is about but it sounds very much i am afraid like the us trying to have a separate operation and not work with the rest of the world through the un system she added cherie accused of attacking bush cherie blair has been accused of criticising george w bushs policies in a private address she gave during a united states lecture tour the prime ministers wife is said to have praised the supreme court for overruling the white house on the legal rights of guantanamo bay detainees the tories said she broke a convention that british political figures do not act in a partisan way when abroad but downing street said she was speaking in her capacity as a lawyer it said she was not expressing political opinions mrs blairs remarks are said to have been made in a speech to law students in massachusetts she said the decision by the us supreme court to give legal protection to two britons held at guantanamo bay was a significant victory for human rights and the international rule of law she also described the us legal code as an outdated grandfather clock and welcomed a decision to throw out a law backed by mr bush relating to sodomy in texas bbc news correspondent gary odonoghue said mrs blair was likely to face further calls for restraint since the us election is imminent there have been some objections from people reasonably close to the bush administration about her making these comments in their backyard just two days before a presidential election he said conservatives here too have made their feelings clear cherie booth has always regarded herself as having an independent career she has continued to practise as a major human rights lawyer in the courts its not unusual for her to make these sorts of criticisms clear but it can be embarrassing mandelson warning to bbc the bbc should steer away from demonising exdowning street media chief alastair campbell peter mandelson has said the european commissioner and former labour minister was speaking amid claims that mr campbell is part of a labour dirty tricks campaign that charge was denied by mr mandelson who said the tories were afraid of mr campbells campaigning skills he warned the bbc that attacking mr campbell had brought it trouble before that was a reference to the hutton inquiry following a bbc story claiming downing street sexed up iraqs weapons of mass destruction dossier the affair prompted the resignation of bbc chairman gavyn davies directorgeneral greg dyke and reporter andrew gilligan labour has attracted media criticism for using new freedom of information laws to dig up information about tory leader michael howards past mr mandelson a former labour communications director told bbc radio s today programme i understand why the tories will be gunning for alastair campbell because they fear his campaigning skills what i understand less is why the bbc should be joining with the tories in driving that agenda in my experience of these things parties which shout about dirty tricks and the like tend to do so because they fear a direct hit in some vulnerable part of their political anatomy i suggest the bbc concentrates on the issues and helps the public to understand the policies and the choices that are at stake in the election rather than engages in the process politics the trivialisation of the campaign i think the bbc would be much better advised to leave all this stuff well alone concentrate on the issues as i say not resume their demonisation of alastair campbell we all know where that led before mr campbell is acting as an adviser for labour which denies engaging in personal campaigning conservative cochairman liam fox said mr campbells return and labour poster plans attacking mr howard recently withdrawn from the partys website were a sign of abusive politics the government despite the fact that they would say want to go forward not back seem intent on talking about history rather than their own record or even more importantly about the future he said on sunday labour peer baroness kennedy who is chairing the power inquiry into political disengagement said people already thought politicians engaged in dirty tricks this feeling of distrust is going to be enlarged if this campaigning on all sides is conducted in the way that it looks as if it just might she said police chief backs drinking move a chief constable has backed the introduction of drinking saying police had a responsibility to ensure people could benefit from a law change however norfolk police chief andy hayman also warned that a great deal of preparatory work was still needed i dont subscribe to the views of some of my colleagues who are coming out and objecting to it he said his comments come after the liberal democrats backed tory demands that the governments plans be put on hold andy hayman said he did not agree with politicians and senior police officers who have objected to the plans which come into force on february i feel that is a premature position to be taking he said among those who have criticised the plans are the uks top policeman sir john stevens the metropolitan police chief said last week that the plans for hour drinking should be reexamined because of a binge drinking epidemic however mr hayman said it would be totally unacceptable in my view for a chief constable to say im very sorry he said that police should make sure that responsible people who wanted a change could benefit from more liberal legislation my view is that i have got a responsibility to create an environment where that can happen he said however he believes a lot of preparatory work is still needed to be done by police local authorities and the drinks industry before the nation was ready for hour drinking but he is confident problems in the early days can be ironed out he believed the majority of people favoured this law change and we have to accept that lifestyles are changing but aspects such as transport and basic things such as making sure public toilets are open all night had to be taken into account prime minister tony blair has defended the licensing act saying it is wrong to deny people the relaxed hours enjoyed elsewhere in europe because of a tiny minority of violent binge drinkers a sixmonth transitional period starts on february during which time venues can apply for extended licences the conservatives have called for hour drinking to be shelved until the problems of binge drinking are solved on monday the lib dems also called for a delay lib dem home affairs spokesman mark oaten said it would clearly be prudent to allow the police and local authorities more time to prepare for flexible drinking hours chief constable mr hayman acknowledged that binge drinking did cause problems if you come to norwich on a friday or saturday night you will see things going on that will you make you feel ashamed however i want industry to succeed in norwich and i want norwich to be the recognised nightspot of east anglia there is no way i want to say we cannot manage it or police it we can game warnings must be clearer violent video games should carry larger warnings so parents can understand what their children are playing the trade and industry secretary has said patricia hewitt is expected to call for the law banning the sale of rated games to children to be enforced better at a games industry meeting on sunday she is concerned too many children are playing games aimed at adults which include high levels of violence parents are expected to spend millions on video games as christmas presents violent games have been hit by controversy after the game manhunt was blamed by the parents of yearold stefan pakeerah who was stabbed to death in leicester in february his mother giselle said her sons killer warren leblanc who was jailed for life in september had mimicked behaviour in the game police investigating the stefans murder dismissed its influence and manhunt was not part of its legal case ahead of sundays meeting in london ms hewitt said she was proud of the uks vibrant games industry but was concerned too many children were playing games which should only be sold to adults roger bennett head of gaming industry body elspa said banning violent games would be wrong he said we dont want to go down that route we have seen that the government is supportive of the industry the government is holding a further meeting on friday with industry and retail representatives as well as the british board of film classification to discuss how labelling can be made clearer ms hewitt said adults should be treated as adults and children as children it is important that retailers respect the classifications and do not sell games with high levels of violence to minors equally parents need to know what they might be buying for their children video games are different to films or videos and not all parents have grown up playing games in the way our children do we need to look carefully at how we improve content warnings and strengthen sales enforcement her call was backed by culture media and sport secretary tessa jowell who said you wouldnt let your child watch the texas chainsaw massacre you wouldnt let them go to a strip club so you shouldnt let them play an rated game its the same principle adults can make their own informed choices but children cant always and need to be protected anyone convicted of selling an rated game to a child can be jailed for six months and fined up to rockstar games the makers of manhunt has said in the past it markets its games responsibly and only targets its adverts at adults mallon wades into ne vote battle middlesbrough mayor ray mallon has been drafted in to boost the yes campaign as the north east assembly referendum enters its final week the former police chief dubbed robocop for his zero tolerance style clashed on thursday with sunderland no campaigner neil herron mr mallon said an assembly would give local people more of a say over key issues such as transport and crime but mr herron said north east people did not want or need an assembly the pair met on the platform at sunderland station as mr mallon toured the region highlighting claimed improvements to transport if the area gets an assembly but mr herron who gained fame as one of sunderlands metric martyrs and is running his own no campaign alongside the official north east says no campaign said he was not convinced by mr mallons arguments the reality is that it is not going to deliver he said labour has had twoandahalf years to convince people of this if you cant sell a deal in that time it is a bad deal on wednesday mr mallon provoked fury by branding the official no campaign twobit tories in a confrontation outside its durham headquarters the campaign is being run by twobit conservatives who are not interested in what happens in the north east they are interested in hitting the labour party over the head he said mr mallon is a late recruit to the yes campaign after rejecting overtures from no campaigners including he claims tory leader michael howard most local observers believe the contest is too close to call although little recent polling has been carried out yes campaign chairman john tomaney said he hoped for a late flurry of votes to boost turnout something he says will boost their cause he added the government exerts a lot of political power in the north east the accountability should be in the north east as well he also defended the decision to attack the official no campaigns alleged political allegiances we felt we had to show what people were behind the no campaign london tory spin doctors graham robb spokesman for north east says no said the yes campaigns decision to get personal dragged the campaign into the gutter and showed they were rattled and he hit back at mr mallons claim that an assembly would improve transport links in the region it can push paper around but it can not get people moving he said some people had returned their ballot papers by wednesday a turnout of the deadline for voting is next thursday november howard rejects bnps claim tory leader michael howard has dismissed claims that his immigration policy was moving onto the turf of the british national party bnp bnp leader nick griffin told the independent he expected some bnp voters to switch to the tories over the issue but mr howard said he rejected the idea that the tories and bnp appealed to the same voting instincts asked if he would welcome bnp voters he told the bbc i dont want anybody to vote for these extremist parties he added on bbc radio s today programme if you want good community relations in this countrythen you have to have firm fair immigration controls the tories have promised an upper limit on the number of people allowed into britain with the slogan its not racist to impose limits on immigration all parties are stepping up campaiging in the runup to the general election widely expected to be called for may labour has unveiled its own points system for ensuring migrants who want to work in the uk have skills that are required but have rejected immigration quotas the liberal democrats have warned both parties against pandering to prejudice mr griffin told the independent the tories plans were a definite move onto our turf he said i quite freely accept that on a nationwide basis the tories will con enough people to make a significant hole in our vote asked whether he was comfortable with the perception that the conservatives and the bnp appeal to the same voting instincts mr howard told the bbc i reject that entirely he said he found bnps policies abhorrent but he said the uk had to take a different approach to immigration which he said was out of control the government doesnt want to limit it in any way we do theres a legitimate difference between us there which we can discuss in a calm rational and reasonable way he said he again rejected newspaper speculation that his own father entered britain illegally tories opposing hour drinking the tories say plans to extend pub opening times should be put on hold until binge drinking is under control despite backing a law change last year spokesman david davis said ministers had failed to make his party aware of concern among senior police that plans would cause more antisocial behaviour notts police chief steve green said innocent people would suffer but culture secretary tessa jowell said a delay would be disastrous and she accused the tories of opportunism the government would go ahead with the changes which would give police more power to tackle excessive drinking she added earlier chief constable green questioned how his officers would be able to practically apply powers allowing them to shut down problem premises if you look at the market square in nottingham if a fight takes place which licensed premises do you go and lay the responsibilty at the door of he asked on bbc radio s world at one programme he warned that if drinking establishments were allowed to open until three or four in the morning the police would have to take officers off day shifts in order to do their job effectively at night earlier this year the royal college of physicians said it opposed the plan to extend drinking hours when there was already an epidemic of binge drinking minister richard caborn said the government was tackling the causes and the symptoms of the problem by allowing more powers to close down problem premises it is hoped that allowing pubs and clubs to stay open longer will stagger closing times and end the current situation where drinkers spill on to the streets all at once earlier tony blair defended the plans against criticism from one of his own backbenchers my view of this is very clear we should have the same flexibility that other countries have and then we should come down really hard on those who abuse that freedom and dont show the responsibility he told mps the lawabiding majority who want the ability after going to the cinema or theatre say to have a drink at the time they want should not be inconvenienced we shouldnt have to have restrictions that no other city in europe has just in order to do something for that tiny minority who abuse alcohol who go out and fight and cause disturbances to take away that ability for all the population even the vast majority who are law abiding is not in my view sensible this week a judge claimed easy access to drink was breeding urban savages and turning town centres into no go areas judge charles harris qc made his remarks as he sentenced three men for assaults carried out while drunk and high on drugs after a night out new foot and mouth action urged a senior tory mp has criticised agriculture department defras lackadaisical approach to planning for a future foot and mouth outbreak public accounts committee chairman edward leigh was giving his reaction to a report by a government watchdog on lessons to be learnt from the crisis the national audit office said defra had improved its capacity to deal with future livestock disease outbreaks but mr leigh said the department was dragging its heels that comment referred to the setting up of a scheme to share any future compensation costs with industry he also said defra had been dreadfully slow in paying some of its bills dating from the foot and mouth crisis the outbreak which began in led to the slaughter of million animals devastated many farms and rural businesses and is estimated to have cost the uk up to bn four years after the outbreak defra is yet to begin its planned review of some of its contractors costs and m of invoices remain unpaid mr leigh said mr leigh also pointed out that the introduction of an it system to help control future outbreaks had been delayed in november it emerged european commission compensation amounted to just over a third of the money the uk government had hoped to get as reimbursement for the billions lost through the foot and mouth crisis ministers had hoped to get m from the european union vet fund to help with animal slaughter and other costs but in the end was granted m that was because the uk had valued the culled animals at between two and three times the commissions assessment of their likely market value national audit office chief sir john bourn said a new compensation scheme was now being looked at on the issue of the unpaid invoices sir john said defra had paid of the bn submitted by contractors since but has not agreed a final settlement with contractors pending the results of its investigations mr leigh said being better prepared would also help avoid the need for mass funeral pyres which provided an unsettling images of the outbreak a defra spokesman said we welcome the report it acknowledges the progress the department has made since particularly on contingency planning and our improved capacity and preparedness for combating another major disease outbreak however the department is aware that there are some areas requiring further work and we are working to resolve them as soon as is practicable correction agency plans dropped plans to create a single correctional agency for scotland have been scrapped the scottish executive will not now merge the scottish prison service with local authority social work criminal justice departments the national correctional agency would have provided a onestop justice system but has been abandoned in the wake of stiff opposition instead scottish councils and the prison service will be compelled to work more closely to cut reoffending the plan was to ensure offenders were monitored by the same body during and after prison preventing many from being lost in the system and helping more of them to stop reoffending scotlands reoffending rate is high with more than of prisoners reconvicted within two years of release from jail this is leading to an everexpanding prison population and the executive wants to tackle the problem ministers thought merging the prison service with the councilcontrolled criminal justice social work departments which provide community sentences might have provided an answer however following a consultation on the idea justice minister cathy jamieson has decided to drop the plans instead ms jamieson will change the law to help produce a closer working relationship between both elements of the justice system she will announce the move in her criminal justice plan on monday aiming to break down the barriers between what happens in prison and what happens in the community the new measures will place a new statutory duty on the sps to work with local authorities and others in area partnerships a national advisory board on offender management will also be created to advise ms jamieson on the spss role and performance in reducing reoffending the minister said better joint working will help prisons play a much stronger role in ending reoffending behaviour and in particular help address the revolving door of reoffending that sees offenders entering prison for short periods during which little is done to address the behaviour that brought them there communities who are paying the price for this reoffending both in terms of crime and in terms of prison costs expect better it costs the taxpayer a year to provide each prison place and that cost is increasing taxpayers who suffer the consequences of crime also end up paying for keeping those people in prison therefore as we continue to invest in the service it is only right that we seek to ensure that that service becomes more accountable to the public it serves to ministers and to parliament blairs hope for blunkett return the events leading to david blunketts resignation must not swept under the carpet the tories have warned on wednesday tony blair said he hoped the former home secretary would serve again in government in the future mr blunkett quit in december after a probe linked him to the visa application of his exlovers nanny mr blair said he left without a stain on his character but tory dominic grieve branded the way mr blunketts office operated as scandalous mr blair told bbc radio s today programme i know david very well and i believe him to be a man of real integrity and real ability and i was very sad for him as to what happened he said mr blunkett still had an immense amount to offer the country but he was not making any guarantees or definitive statements about future jobs but shadow attorney general mr grieve said while i dont rule out the possibility that mr blunkett may return as a minister i dont think its something that can simply be brushed under the carpet senior labour backbencher martin oneill who chairs the commons trade committee said he believed the prime minister would want one of his praetorian guard a reference to the elite body guard of roman emperors back alongside him but colleague ian gibson who chairs the science and technology committee said there was a question mark as to whether mr blunkett could serve at cabinet level again february poll claim speculation reports that tony blair is planning a snap general election for february have been described as idle speculation by downing street a spokesman said he had no idea where the reports in the sunday times and sunday telegraph had come from the papers suggest ministers believe the government could benefit from a baghdad bounce following successful iraq elections in january a british general election was last held in february in in that election edward heath lost and failed to build a coalition with the liberals harold wilson took over and increased his majority later in the year in a second election the latest speculation suggests the prime minister favours a february poll in order to exploit his current opinion poll lead over conservative leader michael howard but that strategy could prompt criticism he was seeking to cut and run after less then four years of a parliamentary term the papers report that alan milburn labours head of elections strategy has played a key role in the plan for a february election which would include a new year advertising blitz new labours campaign both newspapers said would be centred around the slogan britain is working a labour party spokesman said the election date was ultimately a matter for mr blair but he was unaware of anything to suggest it would be in february most commentators have been expecting an election on may the last election was in june abbas will not tolerate attacks palestinian leader mahmoud abbas has said he will not tolerate attacks such as last fridays suicide bombing in the israeli city of tel aviv in an interview ahead of a meeting in london to discuss palestinian reforms mr abbas said such attacks were against palestinian interests the palestinian authority pa was exerting a effort to end the violence mr abbas added the attack which killed five was the first of its kind since he took office mr abbas confirmed israel shared information with the pa in the hunt for the organisers of the attack the israeli government refuses to accept syrias denials that it was implicated in the nightclub bombing israeli officials gave an intelligence briefing to foreign ambassadors on monday explaining syrias alleged involvement british foreign minister jack straw said there had been a continuing stream of information suggesting palestinian militant groups were operating from within syria in an email interview in the british newspaper the independent mr abbas said we believe peace is possible now and we are ready to negotiate with israel to reach a true and lasting peace based on justice and international legitimacy he added we have an opportunity and it would be irresponsible if we the israelis or the world allow it to slip away tuesdays meeting on palestinian reform is being hosted by british prime minister tony blair also due to attend are us secretary of state condoleezza rice un secretary general kofi annan world bank officials and foreign ministers from european and arab countries the conference was a vital step in renewing the peace process mr straw said its a highlevel attendance which reflects the sense of momentum and opportunity created by recent events he added a spokesman for mr blair said the prime minister expected the conference to discuss a comprehensive coordinated and above all practical work plan for both the palestinian authority and the international community israel will not attend but is said to be closely watching the outcome thousands join strike in wales thousands of civil servants were on strike across wales on friday in protest at planned job cuts a range of services in wales were affected as civil servants in wales joined the ukwide strike the strike called by the public and commercial services union was the biggest by civil servants in a decade the action follows chancellor gordon browns announcement in july that jobs would be cut with around of those expected in wales the worstaffected area in wales will be the department of work and pensions where jobs are threatened across wales pickets were held by striking civil servants with protests in towns and cities including cardiff bangor aberystwyth and wrexham gordon brown issued a defiant statement about the strike saying the action would not affect the governments determination to make savings in order to increase investment in healthcare education transport and the fight against crime our decisions mean more police more teachers more doctors and more nurses he said we will provide help with information relocation and retraining to help staff move into frontline work within the public sector but we will not be diverted from these necessary changes so that we can make this essential investment the ukwide action hit jobcentres benefit agencies pensions offices and driving test centres the strike also affected the welsh assembly building in cardiff bay where only passholders were allowed in pickets were in place across wales with protests around the country pcs union spokesman jeff evans said in wales the civil service is major employer there are more civil servants employed in wales proportionately than in any other part of the country our protest is about defending jobs and also local services across the country parts of objective one areas and welshspeaking areas will be particularly affected by these cuts the chancellor has said that the cuts will allow funding for more teachers and police piers freelove is senior benefit officer on the picket line at companies house in cardiff he said the majority of people have decided not to come in because of the threat to their jobs i joined the civil service to provide services as well as get a decent pension as we thought and pay and its those services that are being threatened as well as our jobs people like pensioners need a facetoface service not an impersonal service on the phone which is what they want to impose pcsu deputy general secretary hugh lanning who was on the same picket line said were asking for them to negotiate not just to make announcements theres a sensible way to do things and at the moment theyre not even talking about how to go about it sensibly the ballot was for one days action no further action is anticipated without a further ballot of staff the welsh assembly government said this is a strike about national civil service issues it is not about specific issues local to wales or the assembly top judge clashes with ministers the uks top judge has revealed he has clashed with ministers about how the heads of public inquiries are chosen lord woolf said he was determined his current veto on whether a judge should chair an inquiry should continue as a guard for judicial independence but he told mps the lord chancellor lord falconer was insisting he should have the final say in such cases lord huttons inquiry into the death of dr david kelly sparked debate about who should run inquiries the government says the lord chancellor would be unlikely to go against lord woolfs wishes lord woolf who is lord chief justice of england and wales was giving evidence to the commons public administration select committees inquiry into public inquiries he said he had not been involved in the choice of lord hutton who as a law lord did not come under his jurisdiction but he argued he should have a veto on whether judges generally should chair a particular inquiry and if so which judge it should be in written evidence to the committee lord woolf said i have so far failed to reach an agreement with the lord chancellor on this issue i intend to maintain my position and will press for this safeguard to be in any future legislation judges should think carefully before heading an inquiry into a highly political issue such as the intelligence on iraqs weapons of mass destruction he said he argued the subject matter of the inquiry may be so political that it would be damaging to the judiciary for a judge to be involved in addition the question of whether there should be an inquiry at all may be highly controversial and if a judge is appointed the judiciary as a result of the appointment may be seen as siding inappropriately with the government he told the mps anything that tends to undermine the confidence of the public in the judiciary worries me lord woolf said the current rules were not written down but it was inconceivable in practice that the lord chancellor would overrule his concerns but that situation could change with new legal reforms the issue had been overlooked when a new agreement was drawn up about those responsibilities and the dispute had emerged in later discussions what i am asking for is a situation where if the lord chancellor cannot obtain my agreement on appointing a judge it doesnt happen he said lord woolf said he did not think there would be difficulties but he wanted to establish the principle a department for constitutional affairs spokeswoman said lord woolf and lord falconer agreed about what happened in practice their disagreement is about whether the legislation should include a requirement for consultation or concurrence a very narrow dispute in lord woolfs words she said as lord woolf also acknowledged it is highly unlikely that the lord chancellor would appoint a judge against the wishes of the lord chief justice judges are free to decide for themselves whether to accept positions as inquiry chairs parliament will examine the issue next year when it debates a new bill about public inquiries custody death rate shocks mps deaths in custody have reached shocking levels a committee of mps and peers has warned the joint committee on human rights found those committing suicide were mainly the most vulnerable with mental health drugs or alcohol problems members urged the government to set up a task force to tackle deaths in prisons police cells detention centres and special hospitals there was one prison suicide every four days between and mps said the report which followed a yearlong inquiry by the committee found the high death rate amounts to a serious failure to protect the right to life of a highly vulnerable group many of those who ended up taking their own lives had presented themselves to the authorities with these problems before they even offended the report said it questioned whether prison was the most appropriate place for them to be kept and whether earlier intervention would have meant custody could have been avoided increased resources and a reduction in the use of imprisonment was needed to address the issue in the longer term the report said committee chairman labour mp jean corston said each and every death in custody is a death too many regardless of the circumstances yet throughout our inquiry we have seen time and time again that extremely vulnerable people are entering custody with a history of mental illness drug and alcohol problems and potential for taking their own lives these highly vulnerable people are being held within a structure glaringly illsuited to meet even their basic needs crime levels are falling but we are holding more people in custody than ever before the misplaced overreliance on the prison system for some of the most vulnerable people in the country is at the heart of the problems that we encountered until we change our whole approach to imprisoning vulnerable people we cannot begin to meet our positive obligations under article of the european convention on human rights and meet our duty of care to them the committee also highlighted deeply worrying cases of children and young people taking their own lives between and children have taken their own lives in prison and two have died in secure training centres it picked out the case of joseph scholes who hanged himself from the bars of his cell in stoke heath young offender institution in march and urged the home secretary to hold a public inquiry it revealed that two weeks before his court appearance for a series of robberies the yearold was depressed exhibiting suicidal tendencies and slashed his face with a knife about times even though the trial judge had been alerted to his experience of sexual abuse and mental illness he was sentenced to a twoyear detention and training order nine days into his sentence joseph hung himself from the bars of his cell window with a sheet new rules tackle sham weddings new rules on marriage for foreign nationals living in the uk are coming into force from tuesday most noneu citizens will need home office approval to marry the home office says the new rules are aimed at reducing the number of sham marriages of which there are estimated to be up to a year but immigrants group the joint council for the welfare of immigrants jcwi says the rules breach human rights law and it may mount a legal challenge when the changes were unveiled last year immigration minister des browne said our aim is to avoid unnecessary disruption of genuine marriages while providing firm controls to prevent abuse under the previous regulations anybody wishing to get married in the uk only had to produce evidence they had been resident in the country for a week and give days notice of the wedding at the local register office but from tuesday all noneu nationals apart from citizens of switzerland liechtenstein iceland or norway intending to wed in the uk must either obtain a visa allowing them to get married before they enter the country or apply for a home office certificate of marriage approval to get a certificate costing applicants will have to send proof that they have a legal right to be in the uk those without a settled status such as asylum seekers awaiting a decision on their application will have no right to marry in the uk once they have the necessary documentation those subject to immigration controls wishing to get married in england or wales must register their intention to marry at one of speciallydesignated register offices they can however marry at the register office or church of their choice rhian beynon of the jcwi said the new rules were not proportionate and discriminatory these rules means in some cases the home secretary is going to be a marriage registrar of last resort were currently taking a legal opinion on this well be looking for people whose right to marry is breached and well be looking at taking a case on this to the human rights court ms beynon said the new rules have also been called into question by the parliamentary joint committee on human rights in a report published last july the crossparty committee stated there was a significant risk the new procedures were incompatible with the right to marry because they introduced restrictions which were disproportionate the committee believed the new laws might be incompatible with the human rights act on the grounds of religion belief and nationality the report added over the last year immigration service operations against marriages of convenience have been stepped up resulting in a growing number of convictions in january people who took part in a sham marriage network based in leicester were jailed for a total of years and last november samuel amoah a belgian national who set up two sham weddings for couples who wanted to remain in the uk was jailed for three years several other cases are currently going through the courts the role of registrars who under the asylum and immigration act were obliged to report suspected sham marriages to the home office has been key in many prosecutions registrars spokesman mark rimmer said they welcomed the new marriage regulations and believed they would be an significant deterrent they will effectively remove most of the blatant cases certainly those who are illegals in this country of which we had quite a few will no longer be getting married mr rimmer said mr rimmer the service director for registrations of marriages at brent council in northwest london said he did not consider the new law to be an infringement of civil liberties it may be seen to be far more draconian than it has been but certainly its still not as difficult to marry in the uk than it is to marry for example in holland germany or france i think its a proportionate response by government to what was a very large problem mr rimmer said ministers naive over phonetaps the government is being naive by refusing to allow phonetap evidence in court a senior eu politician says javier solana eu foreign policy chief says phonetap evidence works in the courts of other european countries human rights groups top police officers and many mps say allowing the evidence would remove the need to detain terror suspects without charge but home secretary charles clarke says the evidence would not make much difference to these cases mr solana told itvs jonathan dimbleby programme phonetap evidence in court works it is normal that it is done it would be naive not to do it it would be naive not to use this technological thing that we have at our disposal mr solanas comments come the day after sir ian blair the newlyappointed metropolitan police commissioner said he was in favour of phonetap evidence under the antiterrorism crimes and security act foreign terror suspects can be detained in british jails without trial or charge several suspects have been detained under these powers because evidence against them was deemed too sensitive to be heard in court some of this evidence is believed to be telephone intercepts human rights group liberty has argued that if intercept evidence could be heard these detainees could be brought to trial but critics of phonetap trials say the evidence is often weak and can expose the methods of the security services the home secretary says intercepts would not make much difference because cases against terror suspects frequently rely on other kinds of surveillance but mr clarke has been forced to change the regime of detention without trial after law lords ruled it illegal he has opted for a system of control orders whereby suspects both british and foreign can be held under house arrest or surveillance these orders will again involve a uk optout of parts of the european convention on human rights while accepting that people have to be prepared for a possible terrorist attack mr solana said he had qualms about the home secretarys new plans we have to fight terrorism with all our means but not so far as to change our way of life he said blair dismisses quit claim report tony blair has dismissed reports he told gordon brown he would quit before the next general election you dont do deals over jobs like this the prime minister told bbc ones breakfast with frost programme according to a new book browns britain mr blair went back on a pledge to make way for mr brown after cabinet allies intervened in june mr blair said the claims were reheated from six months ago and that he was concentrating on running the country mr blair said ive dealt with this six months ago i said then you dont do deals over jobs like this you dont what both of us are actually concentrating on are the issues that concern the country the book by sunday telegraph journalist robert peston and serialised in the newspaper said the pair had mutual animosity and contempt for each other it claims tony blair felt by november he had lost voters trust because of the iraq war and that he was no longer an asset to the labour party and that at a dinner hosted by deputy prime minister john prescott he told mr brown of his intention to stand down according to mr peston the prime minister said help me to get through the year and i will then stand down but he then changed his mind in june following intervention from allies in the cabinet and the suspicion that the chancellor was deliberately manoeuvring against him according to the book mr peston told bbc news my understanding is that they are not nearly as close or as friendly as they once were what the book says is there is now a pretty profound mutual mistrust mutual animosity i think in public you see this doubleact pretending everything is alright but in private i dont think the relationship is good because brown understandably feels deeply betrayed particularly over this issue of the leadership but in a wideranging bbc interview covering issues such as the asian tsunami disaster the middle east peace process and northern ireland mr blair said when you get to the top in politics you get this huge swell around you all sorts of people make all sorts of claims and counterclaims he admitted to a sense of frustration about the allegations which he said had been made countless times there has been fresh speculation of a rift recently following their separate responses to the asian tsunami these rumours were fuelled by mr blairs decision to hold his monthly media conference at the same time as a longplanned speech by mr brown on uk plans to tackle global poverty with a new marshall plan for africa there was speculation the pair were trying to outdo each others response to the disaster but the prime minister said he had discussed these claims with the chancellor and dismissed them as a load of nonsense former welfare minister frank field mp said the prime minister should sack mr brown but did not believe mr blair was strong enough to do so tory leader michael howard accused the prime minister and mr brown of squabbling like schoolboys he told sky news sunday with adam boulton this is the politics of the playground and britain really does deserve better the liberal democrat parliamentary chairman matthew taylor said the personal ambition of mr blair and mr brown was getting in the way of good government either they need to grow up and put their squabbles to one side or they cannot expect the electorate to support a divided government at the next election during the interview mr blair also said the former home secretary david blunkett would play a big role at the general election jamieson issues warning to bigots scotlands justice minister has warned bigoted soccer fans that she wants to hit them where it hurts most by banning them from matches cathy jamieson said exclusion orders are one of a series of measures being considered in the scottish executive campaign against sectarianism she praised celtic and rangers for their work in tackling the problem however the minister said stopping sectarian abuse associated with old firm matches is a key objective ms jamieson was speaking ahead of the third round scottish cup clash between the glasgow clubs at parkhead on sunday the sectarianism long associated with sections of the support from both clubs has become a significant target for the executive last week ms jamieson and first minister jack mcconnell met supporters representatives from both clubs to discuss the issue they plan to hold an antisectarian summit next month with officials from the clubs church leaders senior police officers and local authority chiefs among those to be invited speaking on bbc radio scotlands sunday live programme ms jamieson described fridays meeting as very productive and said putting the squeeze on the bigots would be a key aim ms jamieson stressed that sectarianism has not been confined to football but it can act as a trigger for tensions and violence clubs have taken action in the past to ban troublesome fans and supporters groups expressed their desire to ensure that the game is no longer tainted by the problem ms jamieson said the executive should have a role in tackling the soccer troublemakers she said we cant get away from the fact that in some instances some of the religious hatred that some people try to associate with football boils over into violence that is the kind of thing we want to stop and thats the kind of thing supporters groups are very clear they dont want to be part of either and they will work with us to try and deal with that ms jamieson praised the police for their action and said the police do want to identify whether there are particular individuals who are going over the top and inciting hatred or violence they will crack down very effectively on them we have of course already indicated that we will consider the introduction of banning orders to give additional powers to where there are people who are going over the top who have made inappropriate behaviour at football matches to be able to stop them attending the games thats the kind of thing that will hit those kind of people where it hurts the most in not allowing them to attend the games she said praising celtic and rangers for their efforts she said i dont think there is any doubt that we have seen some positive moves from the clubs both rangers and celtic football clubs have been involved in working with the executive to produce for example an educational pack for young people clarke plans migrant point scheme anyone planning to move to the uk will have to pass a test to prove they can contribute to the country home secretary charles clarke has said he is proposing a points system similar to australias but would avoid the quota system planned by the tories mr clarke who will unveil his plans on monday said economic migration helped the uk but needed proper policing the lib dems say they will look at his plans but tory liam fox said his party offered a clear choice on the issue the conservative party cochairman said the british electorate had a choice between a labour government that had done nothing for eight years and will not set a limit on immigration and a tory one that would impose quotas the home secretary said by he wanted everyone given a visa and entering the uk to have their fingerprints taken to ensure we can know everybody who is in the country speaking on bbc ones breakfast with frost he said economic migrants are of great value to this country but stressed that proper policing was needed to ensure that they do not become a burden on society he said we will establish a system which looks at the skills talents and abilities of people seeking to come and work in this country and ensures that when they come here they have a job and can contribute to the economy of the country the home secretary whose fiveyear blueprint for immigration and asylum is expected to be published on monday also rejected claims that the immigration debate encouraged bigotry the issue of who does come into this country and whether they are entitled to be in this country who does settle here how we have border controls is a perfectly legitimate aspect of public debate he said liberal democrat home affairs spokesman mark oaten said whilst it is good that labour has rejected the tory idea of quotas on asylum the jury is still out on the home offices ability to deliver a fair and efficient asylum system mr howard has said britain should take its fair share of the worlds genuine refugees but he claims the current asylum system is being abused and with it britains generosity trevor phillips chairman of the commission for racial equality called on mr clarke to denounce the suggestion britains hospitality was being tested by immigration tell that to the doctors in the nhs and the nurses without whom we would really see what pressure on the health service means he said ditto the teachers from south africa australia jamaica who are reducing the sizes of our classes and schools the refugee council said mr howards proposals would mean there would be no safe haven in the uk voters reject eu by two to one british voters would reject the european constitution by two to one according to a poll posing the question the government will put to the country the daily telegraph poll suggests that of people would vote against the constitution and in favour however the yougov poll which questioned british adults online found did not know how they would vote if forced to decide tomorrow only of those polled had made up their minds about the constitution another said they would not vote at all the poll is believed to be the first to pose the question which the government has chosen for the upcoming referendum expected in the constitution will be incorporated into uk law if there is a yes vote ballot papers in the poll will ask should the united kingdom approve the treaty establishing a constitution for the european union the government unveiled the question which will be asked earlier in the week the treaty was signed by all current eu members in rome last october and is due to come into force in november providing it is ratified by all member states several of which will hold a referendum critics say the constitution is a further step towards a federal europe but advocates say it ensures effective operation of the enlarged state eu if we reject this treaty britain will be isolated and weak in europe said foreign secretary jack straw after the question was unveiled mr straw along with the rest of the cabinet will back a yes vote meanwhile conservative shadow foreign secretary michael ancram said the referendum question seems straightforward but he accused the government of trying to confuse the issue by putting the eu referendum question in the same bill as the ratification of the constitution when they should be treated as two separate issues kennedy questions trust of blair lib dem leader charles kennedy has said voters now have a fundamental lack of trust of tony blair as prime minister he said backing his party was not a wasted vote adding that with the lib dems what you see is what you get he made his comments at the start of a day of appearances on channel five in a session on the wright stuff programme questions from callers a studio audience and the shows presenter covered lib dem tax plans antiterror laws and immigration mr kennedy said during his nearly years in parliament he had seen prime ministers and party leaders come and go and knew the pitfalls of british politics was when i was first elected as an mp so tony blair michael howard and myself were all class of and over that nearly quarter of a century the world has changed out of recognition he said we dont actually hear the argument any longer lib dems good people reasonable ideas but only if we thought they could win around here its a wasted vote you dont hear that because the evidence of peoples senses demonstrates that it isnt a wasted vote but he said mr blair had lost the trust of the british people there is a fundamental lack of trust in tony blair as prime minister and in his government he said what weve got to do as a party what ive got to do as a leader of this party is to convey to people that what you see is what you get mr kennedy also used his tv appearance to defend his partys plans to increase income tax to for those earning more than saying it would apply to just of the population he said the extra revenue would allow his party to get rid of tuition and topup fees introduce free personal care for the elderly and replace the council tax with a local income tax mr blair has already spent a day with five and michael howard is booked for a similar session terror detainees win lords appeal detaining foreign terrorist suspects without trial breaks human rights laws the uks highest court has ruled in a blow to the governments antiterror measures the house of lords law lords ruled by an eight to one majority in favour of appeals by nine detainees most of the men are being indefinitely held in belmarsh prison south london the law lords said the measures were incompatible with european human rights laws the men will stay behind bars while ministers decide how to react the ruling creates a major problem for charles clarke on his first day as home secretary following david blunketts resignation the liberal democrats say mr clarke should use the fact he is new to the job to take issue with a law established by his predecessor david blunkett belmarsh prison has been dubbed britains guantanamo bay by civil rights campaigners opposed to the use of emergency antiterror laws the detainees took their case to the house of lords after the court of appeal backed the home offices powers to hold them without limit or charge the government opted out of part of the european convention on human rights concerning the right to a fair trial in order to bring in antiterrorism legislation in response to the september attacks in the us any foreign national suspected of links with terrorism can be detained or can opt to be deported however those detained cannot be deported if this would mean persecution in their homeland on thursday senior law lord lord bingham said the rules were incompatible with the european convention on human rights as they allowed detentions in a way that discriminates on the ground of nationality or immigration status lord nicholls of birkenhead in his ruling said indefinite imprisonment without charge or trial is anathema in any country which observes the rule of law it deprives the detained person of the protection a criminal trial is intended to afford he said the weakness for the governments case was that it was trying to justify detention without trial for foreign suspects but not for british suspects lord hoffmann said the real threat to the life of the nation in the sense of a people living in accordance with its traditional laws and political values comes not from terrorism but from laws such as these but lord walker of gestingthorpe the one law lord to oppose the appeal said the antiterror laws contained important safeguards against oppression in a statement detainee a in woodhill prison said i hope now that the government will act upon this decision scrap this illegal law and release me and the other internees to return to our families and loved ones the case was heard by a panel of nine law lords rather than the usual five because of the constitutional importance of the case ben emmerson qc representing seven of the detainees said the men had already been in custody for nearly three years he said they had been given no idea when if ever they would be released had never been formally interviewed and there was no prospect they would ever be put on trial when the men were first held they took their cases to the special immigration appeals commission siac the commission ruled on july that the antiterror act unjustifiably discriminated against foreign nationals as british people could not be held in the same way but that ruling was later overturned by the court of appeal who said there was a state of emergency threatening the life of the nation blair to face mps amid feud talk tony blair faces his first prime ministers questions of after a week of renewed speculation about his relationship with gordon brown meanwhile the chancellor is leaving britain on a highprofile tour of africa to highlight poverty issues but before doing so he insisted he still trusted mr blair despite claims to the contrary in a new book labour mps have warned against disunity and tory leader michael howard may well take up the theme in the commons the tories have already accused the prime minister and his chancellor of behaving like schoolboys squabbling in a playground michael howard is likely to want to capitalise further on the spat when he goes headtohead with the prime minister in the commons at a campaign poster launch on tuesday mr brown was joined by alan milburn who mr blair controversially put in charge of election planning in place of the chancellor later this week the prime minister is due to set out the themes of his partys next election manifesto which for the past two polls have been drawn up by the chancellor mr brown meanwhile is visiting tanzania mozambique and kenya to highlight the plight of many africans hit by aids war and famine issues which mr blair has also spoken out on the prime minister and chancellor faced backbench discontent at mondays meeting of the parliamentary labour party over claims made in journalist robert pestons new book mr blair told mps and peers i know from everyone here in cabinet and government nothing is going to get in the way of a unified labour party with a unified position and winning the third term people desperately need labours paul flynn said the pair had had a scorching from mps on tuesday deputy prime minister mr prescott told bbc news they told us very clearly it was the troops telling the leaders get in line the new book claims mr prescott hosted a dinner in november where the prime minister told mr brown he would stand down before the next election because he had lost trust over the iraq war mr blair then changed his mind in june after cabinet allies intervened and amid suspicion the chancellor was manoeuvring against him writes mr peston in mr pestons book mr brown is alleged to have told the prime minister there is nothing you could ever say to me now that i could ever believe labour pig poster antisemitic the labour party has been accused of antisemitism over a poster depicting michael howard and oliver letwin who are both jewish as flying pigs prospective tory candidate andrew mennear whose finchley constituency contains a large jewish community branded it tasteless and offensive the poster shows the two mens faces superimposed on winged pigs and says the day the tory sums add up labour said the poster was not antijewish but antitory it is one of four designs emailed to labour members who were asked to vote for their favourite mr mennear who was sent the email by a friend said he had been shocked by the image and had shown it to friends who were similarly horrified he said there was nothing more distasteful for a jewish person than to be associated with a pig i am not suggesting there is any deliberate intent but these sort of things can cause great offence it clearly wasnt thought through it is possible the posters were designed for maximum impact but this one clearly overstepped the mark and should be withdrawn the campaign was particularly insensitive as it had come out at the same time as holocaust day a difficult time for many jewish people mr mennear added a labour spokesman denied the campaign was antisemitic as we said at the time the james report the tory backed inquiry into possible public spending savings was published pigs will fly before the torys sums will add up this poster is making a serious point he said a conservative party spokesman said while the conservatives are concentrating on the issues that matter to people such as lower taxes and controlled immigration it is clear to see that the labour party is not people will not be fooled iraqis win death test case probe the family of an iraqi civilian allegedly killed by uk troops have won a challenge against the governments refusal to order a full inquiry the high court ruled on tuesday that baha mousas death in british custody in iraq fell within the european convention on human rights and the judges paved the way for an independent inquiry by saying previous investigations were inadequate but judicial reviews into five other deaths in southern iraq were ruled out their families will be appealing against the judgement the families solicitor phil shiner described it as a historic day for human rights and the rule of law in the uk fatheroftwo mr mousa a hotel receptionist was arrested with eight men seized at a hotel in basra in september he was allegedly beaten to death while in the custody of the queens lancashire regiment the iraqi families lawyer argued that failing to adequately investigate the death breached the european convention on human rights ministry of defence lawyers argued the ukcontrolled area of southern iraq was outside european jurisdiction but lord justice rix and mr justice forbes ruled that uk jurisdiction could extend to a ukrun prison but did not apply to the total territory of another state they said as mr mousa was in custody when he died his case came within the uks jurisdiction the other five iraqis did not die in custody so their cases had to fail they said and it was difficult to say that the investigation which had already occurred has been timely open or effective the judges said after the ruling carla ferstman legal director of the human rights organisation redress said it is not enough for the military to investigate behind closed doors there must be an effective public investigation by an independent official body only such an investigation could reveal what really happened and who might be responsible other allegations involving british soldiers included the shooting of an iraqi police commissioner and the shooting of four iraqi civilians in may both sides were granted permission to appeal prime minister tony blairs official spokesman said obviously we will need to study this detailed judgment i would point out however that a separate criminal case is currently being considered by the army prosecuting authority i cant say anything further for obvious reasons the mod are considering whether to appeal but former british commander colonel bob stewart said anyone at the top of the military will be saddened by the verdict that has taken place but will say if theres a case to answer lets have it out because we dont want people thinking that british soldiers beat up civilians and get away with it he said the ministry of defence does everything in its power to try to prove we act ethically and properly under the rules of war burglar defence guidelines issued householders who injure or even kill intruders are unlikely to be prosecuted providing they were acting honestly and instinctively new guidelines say the law also protects those who use something to hand as a weapon the leaflet published by police and prosecutors aims to combat confusion about current legislation which lets people use reasonable force the guidance relating to england and wales follows a recent decision by ministers not to change the law doing what you honestly and instinctively believed was necessary would be the strongest evidence of acting lawfully the guidance said and the law protects those who use something to hand as a weapon said the leaflet published jointly by the crown prosecution service cps and association of chief police officers acpo as a general rule the more extreme the circumstances and fear felt the more force can be used lawfully in selfdefence it said adding that householders do not have to wait to be attacked before defending themselves but knocking someone unconscious then killing them or hurting them further or setting a trap for an intruder without involving the police were given as examples of excessive and gratuitous force the tories have called for a change in the law so householders are only prosecuted if they use grossly disproportionate force their demands have been backed by former metropolitan police commissioner sir john stevens tory frontbencher patrick mercer is now pursuing the proposal through a private members bill in parliament the government instead mounted a publicity campaign to clear up public uncertainty after a review concluded no law change was necessary home secretary charles clarke said i believe in that old adage an englishmans home is his castle thats exactly what should be the case and i believe the current law provides that an informal trawl of cps records found people had been prosecuted after attacking intruders in the past years five of whom were convicted they included a man who laid in wait for a burglar on commercial premises in cheshire before beating him up throwing him into a pit and setting him on fire a cps spokesperson said the figures were not definitive because prosecutions are not listed according to whether they were committed by a householder on an intruder in one of britains highest profile cases norfolk farmer tony martin was jailed for life for murdering yearold burglar fred barras in the conviction was later reduced to manslaughter on appeal and the sentence cut to five years mr martin was freed from prison in july the guidance published on tuesday said the police had a duty to investigate all incidents involving a death or injury in cases involving householders attacking intruders prosecutors and police were determined they would be dealt with as swiftly and as sympathetically as possible it said woolf murder sentence rethink plans to give murderers lighter sentences if they plead guilty have been watered down there was an outcry three months ago when the sentencing guidelines council led by lord woolf published its proposals for england and wales it had suggested judges should reduce sentences by a third for murderers who confessed at the earliest opportunity but that has now been changed to onesixth with no reduction for those killers given a whole life tariff at the time lord woolf the lord chief justice had said the one third reduction would only be in extraordinary circumstances for example if people gave themselves up before their crime had even been detected the guidelines were to recognise the need to spare victims and witnesses the trauma of going to court where possible by allowing lighter sentences for guilty pleas and cooperation he said but director of the victims of crime trust norman brennan accused lord woolf of having an arrogant contempt for victims of crime and the lawabiding public the national association of probation officers said the move would be political suicide in revised proposals from the sentencing guidelines council sgc the section on murder said possible reductions would have to be weighed carefully by a judge so they did not lead to an inappropriately short sentence where it was appropriate to reduce the minimum term having regard to a plea of guilty the maximum reduction would be one sixth and should never exceed five years it said in a statement issued on wednesday lord woolf said i have no doubt that being able to call on the diverse backgrounds and experiences of all those that serve on the sgc has vastly improved the final guidelines i am confident as a result that judges will be better placed to deliver sentences which are effective both as punishments and deterrents to offending and reoffending director of public prosecutions ken macdonald qc who sits on the sgc said the principle of discounting sentences to offenders for early guilty pleas is set down by parliament what the new guideline on reduced sentences for guilty pleas does is increase the chances of convicting the guilty by bringing clarity to this process it represents a tougher regime than existed previously because the discount is automatically reduced if a guilty plea is not made at the first available opportunity he said probe launched on ken nazi jibe an investigation by the standards board is under way following allegations that ken livingstone has brought his office into disrepute the probe follows the london mayors comments to a jewish journalist comparing him to a concentration camp guard after a party about a week ago the local government watchdog also said the allegation related to a failure to respect others it has the power to suspend or bar labours mr livingstone from office a complaint was made to the body by the board of deputies of british jews and the commission for racial equality speaking after the investigation was announced bob neill leader of the london assembly conservatives said he has behaved in a manner unbecoming of his office and in so doing has shown extraordinarily poor civic leadership his administration is now in crisis on sunday deputy mayor nicky gavron told the bbcs politics show she believed the mayor of london would say sorry on tuesday for offending the wider jewish community the prime minister tony blair is among those who have called for an apology but so far the mayor has refused the mayor accused oliver finegold of the evening standard newspaper of doorstepping him at a predominately gay event held for mp chris smith ms gavron said she thought mr livingstones comments were inappropriate but she did not believe the mayor was antisemitic she said i work very closely with ken so i can speak of what hes like in his guarded and unguarded moments and he is in no way antijewish i wouldnt for a moment work with him if he were on the other hand i think his remarks were inappropriate and i believe it is important and i believe he will come to the point where he says i regret that i have caused offence to the wider jewish community i hope he will do it soon and it is mooted that he is going to make some sort of statement on tuesday few ready for information act thousands of public bodies are illprepared for the freedom of information act due to come into force next month because of government failures say mps from next month anyone will have the power to demand information from a range of public bodies from whitehall departments to doctors surgeries but an allparty committee said it was not confident many would be ready it blamed the department for constitutional affairs for a lack of consistent leadership the act comes into effect in england wales and northern ireland on january while similar measures are being brought in at the same time in scotland it provides the public with a right of access to information held by about public bodies subject to various exemptions but the government department responsible for implementing the change suffered from an unusually high turnover of staff within the department which had seriously interfered with its work said the constitutional affairs select committee it said despite four years of preparations some local authorities and parts of the health sector were still not ready the dca had failed to provide early guidance on technical matters and shown a lack of consistent leadership the mps found committee chairman alan beith said the dca has had four years to prepare for freedom of information but with less than a month to go it appears that some bodies may not be well enough prepared our report shows that in the past support and guidance from the dca which has overall responsibility for guiding the public sector through the process of implementation for the freedom of information regime has been lacking a spokesman for the dca said the dca has provided and will continue to provide strong clear leadership it has delivered a simple liberal fees regime guidance on the act which has been widely praised and expert networks of staff working on freedom of information implementation blunkett unveils policing plans people could be given the mobile phone number of their local bobby under an overhaul of policing in england and wales unveiled by david blunkett the plans include a dedicated policing team for each neighbourhood and a point compulsory customer charter the home secretary said targets would be put in place to ensure that the public got a good response from police local people would also be able to trigger action on specific problems if they felt nothing was being done local councillors would have to show certain conditions had been met before invoking the power and police could refuse the request if the complaints were frivolous would only cause annoyance or would pose too heavy a burden on resources mr blunkett said a new three digit number would be created for nonemergency phone calls to police the best performing police services would get more cash and extra freedoms he said but he would not shirk from stepping in where the public was being failed the home secretarys powers to suspend or sack chief constables are being reviewed after mr blunketts battle with humberside chief david westwood over intelligence failures on soham murderer ian huntley opposition parties also want more local policing to tackle nuisance behaviour and other crime but they accuse ministers of tying the police up with paperwork tory spokesman david davis said the proposals were little more than a taxpayerfunded pr exercise ahead of a general election predicted for next may police forces were already buried under existing government initiatives and there was little in the latest plans to reassure them said mr davis earlier lib dem home affairs spokesman mark oaten said the government was right to want to increase the links between local people and the police but these measures will only work if theyre matched with a cut in the amount of paperwork and investment in modern equipment to keep the police out on the streets before delivering a statement to mps mr blunkett was joined by tony blair at welling school in south east london which is at the heart of a community policing initiative mr blunkett said he wanted to go back to a time when i was very young when you expected the police to be part of the community and the community to be part of policing and where people were joined together in partnership making it work the prime minister said the lawabiding citizen should be in charge of the community and not the minority who want to cause trouble mr blunkett already boasts about producing record police numbers he has also started to recruit community support officers csos and the new plans would allow all police forces to give them the power to detain suspects an extra m was promised on tuesday so new csos can be recruited now rather than next year within two years every force will be expected to keep to a coppers contract on what kind of service the public can expect a mori poll this summer suggested policing unlike health and education was the one major public service where people were less satisfied the more contact they had with it the plans also include the idea of allowing people join police forces at different levels rather than the traditional way of making everybody spend specific amounts of time as a constable before being promoted there will also be specific exercises to encourage black and asian people to join the police at senior ranks jack cunningham to stand down veteran labour mp and former cabinet minister jack cunningham has said he will stand down at the next election one of the few blairera ministers to serve under jim callaghan he was given the agriculture portfolio when labour regained power in mr cunningham went on

period in opposition mr cunningham held a number of shadow roles including foreign affairs the environment and as trade spokesman as agriculture minister he caused controversy when he decided to ban beef on the bone in the wake of fears over bse he quit the government in and in recent years has served as the chairman of the allparty committee on lords reform and has been a loyal supporter of the government from the backbenches kilroy unveils immigration policy exchatshow host robert kilroysilk has attacked uk policy on immigration saying britains open door approach is hitting low wage indigenous workers the veritas leader said the only people to benefit from immigrants from places like poland were employers landlords members of the metropolitan elite the mep said his party would only admit foreigners who were required because they had specific skills to offer and he argued asylum cost bn a year for successful applicants mr kilroysilk said that worked out at per successful asylum seeker he said veritas wanted to grant an amnesty for all those in britain claiming asylum and who have children and deport everyone else britain should take its fair share of asylum seekers

campaign group is to target nine marginal labour seats at the general election save the scottish regiments will also field a candidate against armed forces minister adam ingram in east kilbride the group which is unhappy at defence merger plans is endorsing opposition candidates in nine seats the marginals are aberdeen south dumfriesshire dundee east and west south west edinburgh ochil stirling east renfrewshire and western isles the campaigners unveiled a huge poster featuring black watch soldiers fighting the war in iraq before they announced their election plans former scots guardsman allan hendry will challenge mr ingram the group said it is well organised with volunteers and will be announcing at least one other candidate later it added that it can only be stopped from inflicting serious damage on labour if the government reverses its plan to merge the six scottish regiments scotlands only conservative mp peter duncan said the save the scottish regiments had done a superb job in fighting against defence cuts he added their actions have reflected the pride that most people in this country have in our troops and have shown a steely determination to make labour pay for their betrayal i have been honoured to speak at their rallies throughout scotland scottish national party leader alex salmond said it had received a big boost from the campaigns decision to endorse snp candidates in four marginal seats labours arrogance has been their undoing in trying to get rid of scotlands historic regiments labour mps will end up being scrapped themselves he said however labour mp george foulkes said the campaigners would not make any difference to the outcome of the election and would not win the argument a serving soldier knows that what labour is proposing is right he said as well as their election move save the scottish regiments will join other campaigners at a rally in london in the spring defence secretary geoff hoon announced last year that scotlands regiments would be combined into a single unit the move was part of overall army reforms row over police power for csos the police federation has said it strongly opposes giving community support officers csos the power to detain suspects for up to minutes the powers piloted in six areas were extended to all police forces in england and wales on thursday the federation said csos do not have the experience training and safety equipment to deal with potentially confrontational situations but the government said the move would help police build safe communities police federation chairman jan berry said civilian officers should act as eyes and ears for the police they should not be placed in potentially confrontational situations which detaining someone clearly is she said csos can now use reasonable force to detain suspects for up to minutes while they wait for police officers to arrive the powers will be granted by chief constables of local forces ms berry said this dramatically changes their original purpose to be a visible presence combating lowlevel crime and antisocial behaviour she said more powers would mean more paperwork and less time on the street but home office minister hazel blears defended the move saying it would give the civilian officers just that little bit of edge she denied their role was changing and said the new powers would not take them away from the streets the powers that we are bringing in are things that they need to do when they are out patrolling she said the home office has produced its own report on csos which it describes as encouraging ms blears said the study shows csos are making a real difference in the fight against crime but the report also showed that the public is having difficulties distinguishing between a civilian officer and a proper officer shadow home secretary david davis said the research appeared to acknowledge that csos were having no discernible effect on crime figures while the answer is a lot more real police the government wants to recruit people who cant arrest anyone he said bbc home affairs correspondent danny shaw said the research is inconclusive there are about csos in england and wales but the government intends to have on the streets by at a cost of m they already have powers to hand out fines for a wide range of offences the serious organised crime and police bill proposes extra powers to search suspects enforce licensing offences direct traffic and deter begging councils prepare to set tax rises council tax in scotland is set to rise by an average of about in the coming year bbc scotland has learned authorities will decide final figures on thursday when projected increases will be more than twice the rate of inflation which is currently the finance minister has urged councils to limit increases but they have warned that they will struggle to maintain services unless funding is increased they say much additional government money is for new initiatives scottish finance minister tom mccabe msp said last week in parliament i announced an additional m for core expenditure to local government in scotland thats a increase and sits against an inflation rate of so i think we have quite rightly said to councils this year that we would at the very least ask them to exercise restraint mr mccabe is also looking for local authorities to become more efficient and save money in coming years he told bbc radio scotlands sunday live programme here in scotland we have councils who all have their own individual collection systems for council tax they have their own payroll systems and their own human resource systems we think there has to be opportunities there for rationalisation and using the money saved to reinvest in frontline services the councils umbrella organisation cosla which provided bbc scotland with the indicative figures for next year warned that councils would face a continuous struggle to maintain services mr mccabe has promised them about bn next year however most of the increase is targeted to new initiatives and councils will experience difficulties in maintaining core services a cosla spokesman said cosla says that it is willing to work with the executive on finding efficiency savings but that these will not be enough to maintain services they say the funding plans for the next three years will see councils lose more of the share of public spending the conservatives accuse the scottish executive of using the council tax to raise funds because it is too afraid to raise income tax the tory finance spokesman brian monteith msp said its a form of disguise yet again we see that council tax is being used as a way of passing on costs scared of actually using its three pence income tax that it could put up what weve seen over the years is more and more burdens being put onto local authorities and the council tax payer having to pick up the bill there are also warnings that unless funding to councils is increased in the next few years then services may have to be reduced linda knox director of the scottish local authority management centre at strathclyde university said with this current settlement the increase is slowing at the same time the burdens on councils are greater than they were the settlement figures dont include pay increases and the executive is also requiring a substantial figure in the area of m in efficiency savings across the settlement period education will be protected from any cuts but linda knox says this will mean other services will suffer she said in practice that will mean a cut for other services on the face of it the settlement looks like an increase of about but by the time you take into account other factors its probably only about in real terms whitehall shredding increasing tories civil servants have drastically stepped up the shredding of official documents figures compiled by the tories suggest some government departments had doubled the number of documents being shredded ahead of the freedom of information acts implementation on january departments for defence environment and trade which had all increased file destruction said they were following rules governing public records but the tories want the information commissioner to investigate the freedom of information act will for the first time give members of the public access to government records previously kept secret for years but bbc political correspondent james hardy said the prospect of outsiders poking their noses into the inner workings of whitehall appeared to be causing jitters among the mandarins liberal democrat alan beith who chairs the select committee which monitors the department of constitutional affairs said if the claims were true whitehall was acting entirely against the spirit of the new act both the information commissioner and the select committee will have to keep this issue under very close scrutiny fellow lib dem norman baker said the episode painted an unflattering picture of the inner workings of government it is clear that the governments initial enthusiasm for open government has turned to selfserving cynicism dr julian lewis the conservative spokesman for the cabinet office said he had discovered a huge acceleration in shredding from a series of parliamentary answers the department of work and pensions destroyed nearly files last year up on four years ago when the act was passed the number of files destroyed by the ministry of defence and the departments of environment food and rural affairs and trade and industry has also risen dramatically dr lewis has called for an investigation by the information commissioner richard thomas earlier this week mr thomas said he was looking into cabinet office orders telling staff to delete emails more than three months old he said he totally condemned the deletion of emails to prevent their disclosure under freedom of information laws coming into force on january government guidance said emails should only be deleted if they served no current purpose mr thomas said a cabinet office spokeswoman said the move was not about the new laws or the destruction of important records the freedom of information act will cover england wales and northern ireland from next year similar measures are being brought in at the same time in scotland it provides the public with a right of access to information held by about public bodies subject to various exemptions mps assess scots fishing industry a group of mps are on a twoday factfinding mission to scotland to gather evidence for a report into the uks fishing industry members of westminsters environment food and rural affairs committee will be touring fish markets and talking to fish processors they will also talk to fisheries minister ross finnie and scientists mps are deciding whether to recommend a new system of community quotas to conserve fish stocks the aim is that fishing ports like peterhead or fraserburgh would be allocated a quota and local people would decide how to fish it the scheme is a variation on the local management committees already being established by the european union details are contained in a royal commission report for the uk government along with the more controversial idea of closing some mixed fishing grounds completely six members of the committee will be in scotland to seek views from fishermen and processors in aberdeen and peterhead they will also speak to mr finnie representatives of the royal society and the sea fish industry authority committee chairman austin mitchell said some way has to be found of harvesting mixed fisheries without wasting stocks student inequality exposed teenagers from welloff backgrounds are six times more likely to go to university than those from the most deprived areas a report says the higher education funding council for england said more people went to university between and but the percentage of poorer students hardly changed at all said its chief executive sir howard newby increasingly more women than men went to university while tuition fees and student loans made no major difference the hefce report drawing on child benefits data said teenagers in the richest areas could expect a better than chance of going to university while in the poorest neighbourhoods it was participation at constituency level ranged from in kensington and chelsea in the city of london and westminster and in sheffield hallam down to in bristol south and leeds central and in nottingham north and sheffield brightside sir howard said the report highlighted the entrenched divisions between rich and poor areas but added it was a social as much as an educational problem he told bbc news we know once children from deprived backgrounds get into university they do very well in fact surprisingly more go into postgraduate study than those from more affluent backgrounds the issue is i think one of raising aspirations amongst those families and those communities that university is something for them and not for other people he said by the time universities traditionally dealt with pupils between the ages of and it was too late instead they should be reaching out to communities and schools much earlier even down to primary school level to persuade them a university education was something they could aspire to he said but while the report revealed stark inequalities and exposed the extent of the challenge there were some encouraging findings he added tuition fees and student loans in england and wales and the different fee regime in scotland did not seem to have affected the choices of young people even the poorest the report also showed women were more likely than men to enter higher education in up from in in the poorest areas the gap was in womens favour and growing faster than anywhere else the higher education minister kim howells said we are working in schools to raise the attainment and aspiration of young people in disadvantaged areas higher standards in schools would lead to greater participation in higher education from upfront tuition fees in england would be removed with grants for the less well off the shadow education secretary tim collins said it is clear from this report that children from disadvantaged areas are far more likely to have encountered poor standards in their secondary education tackling these must be the top priority for any government looking to improve university access the group which represents university vicechancellors universities uk said the new system of deferred fees in england due to start in with grants and bursaries for poorer students would encourage more of them to go into higher education the national union of students argued the opposite that the situation was likely to get much worse with poorer students being restricted in choice and having to make decisions based on their financial situation rather than aspiration the tables below show the participation rate for each parliamentary constituency in britain kennedy to make temple address charles kennedy is set to address people at a hindu temple as part of an appeal to ethnic minority voters the liberal democrat leader will visit the shri swaminarayan mandir temple in neasden north west london he will say labour can no longer lay exclusive claim to the votes of britains ethnic minorities mr kennedy will also highlight the anger among people of all races over the iraq war and call for a balanced approach to tackling terrorism saturdays speech comes days after the lib dems launched their ethnic minority minimanifesto mr kennedy is to tell the audience many people in britain of all races cultures and religions were angry about the way we were taken to war in iraq and they saw the principled stand the liberal democrats took at the time he will also say that the lib dems want to restore britains reputation on the world stage by fighting international poverty and climate change and protecting human rights mr kennedy will say that a balanced approach to tackling terrorism would mean tough measures to make britain safe but not at the expense of peoples fundamental legal rights like has happened at belmarsh he will say it also means acting through the united nations on terrorism mr kennedy held talks with tony blair on friday over government plans to hold terror suspects under house arrest he said afterwards that the prime minister had offered some movement to address his concerns the plans face trouble in the lords if conservative and lib dem opposition continues no election tv debate says blair tony blair has said he will not take part in a tv debate with his political rivals ahead of the next election we answer this every election campaign and for the reasons i have given before the answer is no he said at his monthly news conference in october tory leader michael howard said mr blair would be running scared if he refused calls to go headtohead in recent years the leader of the opposition has always called for a debate although it has never happened before the election plans for a debate between mr blair william hague and charles kennedy collapsed in a debate between mr blair and john major was also cancelled when a format could not be agreed televised debates have become the high point of the us presidential election campaigns what the election should really be about a general election is the best chance most pressure groups get to make a real impact on government policy here is how six leading lobbies plan to make sure their cause is being debated ahead of an expected spring poll weve called for the state pension to be increased from to the pensioner credit guarantee level of thats what were calling for many pensioners are disadvantaged by the current system if weve got one in five pensioners below the poverty line weve got to make it more generous or have these people living in poverty weve drawn up a pensioners manifesto this will be sent to each of the candidates in the constituencies they will be asked which of the top five issues including the pension issue they would support once weve got their responses we will publish the results within the constituencies and nationally as well its our way of putting the politicians on notice we are trying to get across the fact that there are m voters over in the country they are more likely to vote than other sections of society and thirdly they are true swing voters before most pensioners voted conservative in and they voted labour but there is no guarantee they will vote for a labour government this time around they cannot take that vote for granted pensions generally will certainly be a big election issue even though the government has postponed the publication of adair turners full report into the issue he said the uk had one of the least generous pensions systems in the developed world that the government takes seriously the impact of aviation on the environment we havent worked out specific plans but i imagine we will lobby political parties and incumbent mps various local groups will do that in their particular areas and we will provide a national briefing we dont have any large demonstrations planned but they cant be ruled out it is hard to say whether we will be successful we have got the issue in the public consciousness to an extent but it is difficult to say whether an election will raise its importance in the public mind or whether it will be pushed out by big issues like iraq repealing the hunting bill we are challenging the use of the parliament act in a high court action we are hoping to hear in the new year whichever way the court rules the other side will appeal so we expect it to fall plumb in electioneering time when the ban comes into force on february we will be going to the european court because no compensation is being paid so theres a lot of legal territory to go we are trying to engage with the ministers by demonstrating and talking whatever intelligence we get we will try to turn up and speak to whoever it is rural affairs minister alun michael has avoided us and cancelled engagements so that makes it difficult it is not intimidatory on the whole it is groups of angry housewives of course there is an element of shouting because people are angry but there is no violence because that does not achieve anything it will fall plumb in the run up to the most important general election tony blair will ever face its exactly what the prime minister did not want he wanted the issue off the table until after the election people using live animals as targets for sport both here and abroad the reason for including abroad is because of trophy hunting it is another sort of form of shooting for sport the principle is the same whether its a tiger or a pheasant we will widely publicise whats happening in relation to trophy hunting we will publicise the darker aspects of the target animal industry the uk we will seek to get pledges from individual mps and wouldbe mps saying that they are against the use of animals as targets for sports we would like the support of political parties but i think a general election is very much to do with pledges mps make to their electors with hunting we had many mps who were happy to say they were against it i think what we will get is a very real climbing up the agenda whether or not we will get a ban i am not sure but it will mobilise public opinion everything we do will reduce animal suffering and in time that will lead to a ban the issue that we think is the most important for this election is choice the language of consumerism is very commonplace in government and across the political spectrum choice as an ideology is beginning to be the privatisation of this decade its become an issue in itself but whats really missing from the debate is the consumers choice in that choice is not choice at all if all you have to choose from is two failing schools we have seen so many pensions misselling scandals and in the pensions industry theres a maximum of choice but a minimum quality in that we want choice on the consumers terms that means clear and accessible information to operate that choice firstly we have our website it features our campaigns and changes every day secondly through our members who communicate with us thirdly through the media and also what we will be doing is holding a preelection conference we will invite the opinion formers mps journalists and others the idea is that we open up communications between members of the public and the politicians i think we will be successful its very much the language being used by the main political parties politicians on all sides are very sensitive to this issue they want to be seen to be responding to this issue fuel duty is a large part of operational costs for road haulage workers we have been hearing about this proposed increase of p per litre that gordon brown has been postponing and postponing tuppence does not sound like a great deal but every year if you operate one vehicle thats an increase of about if youre running vehicles its obviously times that if fuel duty does rise we will be absolutely horrified there will be a huge effect throughout the industry and i would not be surprised if you see widespread demonstrations what it will mean is there will be a number of firms going out of business we will continue to do what we have always done we keep the issue in the trade press regrettably its one of those stories that it is getting harder to get into the national press whatever we do the public dont like lorries they see us as a complaining minority but they dont realise that when you see a car on the road it is probably going to work when you see a lorry its already at work brown and blair face new rift claims for the umpteenth time tony blair and gordon brown are said to have declared all out war on each other this time the alleged rift is over who should take the credit for the governments global aid and debt initiatives particularly in the wake of the tsunami disaster an issue many hoped and believed was above such things it dominated the prime ministers monthly news conference which saw mr blair start in full irritation mode as he was forced to bat away question after question about his relationship with his neighbour as he told journalists i am not interested in what goes in and out of newspapers there is a complete unity of purpose and he again heaped praise on mr brown saying he was doing a great job and would continue doing it although he would not commit to any job for mr brown after the election so why did he arrange his press conference at the last moment so it coincided with mr browns longarranged keynote speech on aid and debt he was asked by now mr blair had moved from irritation mode to his barely disguised fury setting he snapped back that the hacks knew very well what the operational reasons were for the timing of his press conference well not really as it happens and he repeated what a great man gordon was and how united they were before again sneering that he took absolutely no notice of what went in and out of the newspapers preferring to get on with the job of doing the best for the country and the world although in the next breath he declared i get increasingly alarmed by what i read in the newspapers before catching himself on and quickly adding in so far as i read them of course he probably had good reason to be alarmed because the newspapers had been full of stories about the claimed open warfare between the two men as far as the timing of the prime ministers press conference is concerned there are two options the first is that it was a calculated attempt to upstage the chancellor and seize back the initiative on the big issue of the moment if that is the case it suggests that even the fear of seriously negative newspaper headlines is not enough to stop the squabbling the second option is that it was an unavoidable coincidence which would suggest the government has lost its oncefamed ability to strictly coordinate announcements through the infamous downing street grid to avert just such allegations either way the effect was the same to overshadow the big announcements of government policy on a hugely pertinent issue and there had been previous suggestions that the new year had started with a fresh outbreak of the warfare between the two men firstly the prime minister insisted on wednesday that he had been intimately involved in the development of the proposals to get g countries to freeze debt repayments from the tsunamihit countries it was claimed he had been embarrassed by the fact that gordon brown appeared to have taken the initiative over the governments response to the disaster while mr blair was still on holiday in egypt then as if to pour fuel on the flames both men separately spoke about working on tsunami or wider aid and development policy with their cabinet colleagues foreign secretary jack straw aid minister hilary benn and deputy prime minister john prescott without mentioning the other all this came amid fresh claims that mr brown was still seething that he had been excluded from a prominent role in general election planning and had as a result started to set out his own platform the fact that he used an article in the guardian newspaper to set out what he believed should be in the manifesto has embarked on a mini tour of britain to set out his aid plans and will next week visit africa on the same mission often seen as the prime ministers turf has only added to the impression of rival camps operating entirely independently of each other the prime minister denied all that as well repeating his insistence that it was inconceivable the economy and the chancellor would not be at the centre of the election campaign but the big fear with many on the labour benches now is that unless a lid can be put on the speculation over the rivalry it may even threaten to undermine the election campaign itself blair said he would stand down tony blair promised gordon brown he would stand down before the next election a new book about the chancellor claims but the prime minister changed his mind following intervention from allies in the cabinet according to the book the book by sunday telegraph journalist robert peston said the pair had mutual animosity and contempt for each other the book browns britain said tony blair felt by november he had lost voters trust the authors sources all unnamed allies of mr blair and mr brown said the prime minister felt the iraq war had undermined him and that he was no longer an asset to the labour party the book serialised in the sunday telegraph alleges that mr blair told the chancellor at a dinner hosted by deputy pm john prescott in november of his intention to stand down at that stage he saw gordon brown and said look you are the next most influential member of the government i need your help to get through the next year mr peston said i myself recognise that im going to have to stand down before the election but help me to get through the year and i will then stand down but he changed his mind in june following intervention from allies in the cabinet and the suspicion that the chancellor was deliberately manoeuvring against him the book claims mr peston told bbc news my understanding is that they are not nearly as close or as friendly as they once were what the book says is there now a pretty profound mutual mistrust mutual animosity i think in public you see this double act pretending everything is alright but in private i dont think the relationship is good because brown understandably feels deeply betrayed particularly over this issue of the leadership there has been fresh speculation of a rift recently following their separate responses to the asian tsunami rumours of a rift were fuelled by the sudden decision to hold mr blairs monthly media conference at the same time as a longplanned speech by mr brown on uk plans to tackle global poverty with a new marshall plan for africa there was speculation the pair were trying to outdo each others response to the disaster former welfare minister frank field mp criticised the reported rivalry between the pair on gmtvs sunday programme what sort of model does it give to the nation when the two most important political leaders do nothing but fight it out together or use their aides to fight it out the labour mp for birkenhead asked he said the prime minister should sack mr brown but did not believe mr blair was strong enough to do so conservative policy coordinator david cameron mp for witney added if it wasnt so serious it would be funny but it is serious youve got the two most senior people in the government not concentrating on fighting crime poverty or dirty hospitals they are fighting each other carol walker bbc news political correspondent added there is a real concern that this could undermine the general election campaign and clearly it is very bad news for the government at a time when it is trying to explain what it is doing to respond to the terrible problems thrown up by the tsunami disaster blair dismisses quit claim report tony blair has dismissed reports he told gordon brown he would quit before the next general election you dont do deals over jobs like this the prime minister told bbc ones breakfast with frost programme according to a new book browns britain mr blair went back on a pledge to make way for mr brown after cabinet allies intervened in june mr blair said the claims were reheated from six months ago and that he was concentrating on running the country mr blair said ive dealt with this six months ago i said then you dont do deals over jobs like this you dont what both of us are actually concentrating on are the issues that concern the country the book by sunday telegraph journalist robert peston and serialised in the newspaper said the pair had mutual animosity and contempt for each other it claims tony blair felt by november he had lost voters trust because of the iraq war and that he was no longer an asset to the labour party and that at a dinner hosted by deputy prime minister john prescott he told mr brown of his intention to stand down according to mr peston the prime minister said help me to get through the year and i will then stand down but he then changed his mind in june following intervention from allies in the cabinet and the suspicion that the chancellor was deliberately manoeuvring against him according to the book mr peston told bbc news my understanding is that they are not nearly as close or as friendly as they once were what the book says is there is now a pretty profound mutual mistrust mutual animosity i think in public you see this doubleact pretending everything is alright but in private i dont think the relationship is good because brown understandably feels deeply betrayed particularly over this issue of the leadership but in a wideranging bbc interview covering issues such as the asian tsunami disaster the middle east peace process and northern ireland mr blair said when you get to the top in politics you get this huge swell around you all sorts of people make all sorts of claims and counterclaims he admitted to a sense of frustration about the allegations which he said had been made countless times there has been fresh speculation of a rift recently following their separate responses to the asian tsunami these rumours were fuelled by mr blairs decision to hold his monthly media conference at the same time as a longplanned speech by mr brown on uk plans to tackle global poverty with a new marshall plan for africa there was speculation the pair were trying to outdo each others response to the disaster but the prime minister said he had discussed these claims with the chancellor and dismissed them as a load of nonsense former welfare minister frank field mp said the prime minister should sack mr brown but did not believe mr blair was strong enough to do so tory leader michael howard accused the prime minister and mr brown of squabbling like schoolboys he told sky news sunday with adam boulton this is the politics of the playground and britain really does deserve better the liberal democrat parliamentary chairman matthew taylor said the personal ambition of mr blair and mr brown was getting in the way of good government either they need to grow up and put their squabbles to one side or they cannot expect the electorate to support a divided government at the next election during the interview mr blair also said the former home secretary david blunkett would play a big role at the general election could rivalry overshadow election tony blair and gordon brown are desperately trying to stuff the genie of their rivalry back into the bottle along with any number of senior cabinet colleagues they are insisting their only job is to win the next election and govern in the best interests of britain it is a message they are aiming directly at their backbenchers who are becoming irritated and even unnerved by the continuing claims and counter claims surrounding this alleged rift ian gibson for example urged the two men to stop squabbling declaring for goodness sake sometimes you have to rise above petulance and make sure that you do your job as effectively as you can those with slim majorities are particularly fearful that the rift could hit their own hopes of reelection tony blair will seek to reassure labour mps on monday evening at their first meeting of the new year at westminster a behindclosed doors meeting which gordon brown is thought likely to also attend to show unity meanwhile the likes of health secretary john reid and labour peer lord haskins are warning of the electoral dangers of allowing this soap opera to continue and they have both warned the rival camps to stop spreading the poison lord haskins even suggested mr blair should reinstate mr brown as the central figure in the election planning but this particular genie is unusually reluctant to return to captivity and many fear it is simply too late to repair the damage they believe they will be fighting the next election with the sounds of open warfare between the two men ringing in their ears and it matters little whether the rift is real or as some try to suggest simply the product of newspaper headlines and westminster gossip few in westminster actually believe that simply because the evidence appears to contradict it for example the weekends attempts by both men to play down the divisions failed to do the trick even as they were both insisting on their unity of purpose and claiming they would not be swayed by newspaper stories they still managed to stir the speculation with their comments mr blair talked about the new labour manifesto a move which seemed calculated to irritate the chancellor who has long rejected the label and mr brown pointedly refused to deny claims the prime minister had reneged on a deal to hand him the premiership last year that claim was repeated in robert pestons book a book which amply demonstrates this corrosive downing street soap opera is nowhere near its final act for his part mr brown insists his only motivation was to get labour reelected the trouble is both men have fallen short of offering simple straightforward denials of the central claims so they have both been accused of actually making matters worse by feeding the speculation with their own behaviour the first thing to be said is that these suggestions have not come from nowhere they started with and are sustained by friends of the two men one only had to listen to the chancellors friend and former spin chief charlie whelan last week to understand that there is a real anger from this camp at the prime ministers apparent attempts to confound mr browns leadership ambitions but it is not just public pronouncements from exaides there are whispered briefings to selected journalists from both sides it is no secret in westminster for example that downing street believes the chancellor is indulging in a mammoth sulk and acting in a petty and deliberately provocative manner then there are the actions of the men themselves gordon brown sets out what is seen as a rival manifesto then appears to embark on his own personal campaign the prime minister responds by scheduling his monthly press conference to clash with a keynote speech by the chancellor meanwhile large numbers of backbench mps insist voters are either entirely uninterested in the chatter which they believe is a mediaonly obsession or that they fear for the efficient running of a government beset by such rivalry either way there is universal agreement that if this goes on through the general election it can only do the labour party serious damage there are signs that the two men appreciate the dangers and both want to put a lid on all the speculation but with probably only four months to the next election that looks like being a particularly difficult trick to pull off blair pledges unity to labour mps tony blair has sought to reassure labour backbenchers that nothing will stand in the way of the partys bid for a third term in power mr blair was speaking to mps amid fresh rumours of a rift with gordon brown a new book says the prime minister went back on a pledge to mr brown to stand down before the next general election the chancellor has said he is focused on winning the poll and is due to join election supremo alan milburn for a labour poster launch this week mr blair told the parliamentary labour party plp on monday i know from everyone here in cabinet and government nothing is going to get in the way of a unified labour party with a unified position and winning the third term people desperately need the prime minister and his chancellor arrived within seconds of each other and seemingly in good spirits at the start of the meeting which lasted around an hour a new book browns britain by sunday telegraph journalist robert peston says mr blair went back on a pledge to make way for mr brown after cabinet allies intervened in june it has caused a new wave of concern among labour mps gearing up to defend their seats in an election widely expected to be held in may and several members are understood to have lined up to express their discontent at the plp meeting health secretary john reid earlier warned that labour members would not easily forgive anybody fuelling damaging speculation he told bbc news those who cooperate or inspire these books in my view have to know that whatever the shortterm political or personal advantage that they think they might secure they always do it by damaging the record the unity and the reelection chances of the labour party and the government mr blair on sunday dismissed claims of broken promises saying ive dealt with this six months ago i said then you dont do deals over jobs like this you dont in a separate bbc interview mr brown said he and the prime minister would not be distracted by gossip its very important that we all do what we can in a unified way to ensure the election of a labour government he said on monday mr blairs spokesman said the prime minister is determined that he will get on with the business of government because he believes that what people want mr brown says he discussed the election campaign with mr blair on saturday and promised to play his part mr peston said the pair had mutual animosity and contempt mr blair had decided in november he would quit because he felt he had lost voters trust because of the iraq war he had then changed his mind in june following intervention from cabinet allies and suspicion that the chancellor was manoeuvring against him mr brown allegedly said he could no longer believe anything mr blair told him conservative cochairman liam fox likened the two men to selfobsessed schoolboys liberal democrat parliamentary chairman matthew taylor said their personal ambition was getting in the way of good government exlabour leader neil kinnock said mr blair and mr brown could only deal with the media frenzy by continuing to say they would not allow a row to damage labour or british interests he told bbc radio five live that mr brown would never encourage any kind of insurrection or coup blair and brown criticised by mps labour mps have angrily criticised tony blair and gordon brown amid renewed reports of a rift between the two men a meeting of the parliamentary labour party saw a succession of normally loyal members warn that feuding could jeopardise labours election hopes the pm insisted nothing would derail labours campaign despite a new book saying he has upset his chancellor by backing out of a pledge to stand aside mr brown will again be in the public eye at the partys new poster launch in what the party had hoped would be perceived as a show of unity he is due to line up alongside alan milburn the man controversially appointed as the partys election supremo and deputy leader john prescott for the event in london on tuesday relations between mr brown and mr milburn are widely reported to be cool ever since mr blair brought the latter back into the cabinet to run labours election campaign a role successfully carried out by mr brown in both and mr blair told the parliamentary labour party on monday i know from everyone here in cabinet and government nothing is going to get in the way of a unified labour party with a unified position and winning the third term people desperately need the prime minister and his chancellor arrived within seconds of each other for the meeting of the plp and were seemingly in good spirits as it started new speculation about the state of their relationship was sparked by claims in browns britain by sunday telegraph journalist robert peston which suggested mr blair went back on a pledge to make way for mr brown labours paul flynn said mr blair and mr brown had a scorching from mps adding it was a parliamentary labour party meeting like no other backbencher stephen pound said some mps had threatend to expose those fuelling the reports if mr blair and mr brown did not stop this nonsense this poisonous briefing lord campbellsavours a former mp challenged mr brown to deny reports that he had told the prime minister he did not believe anything he said mr prescott said mps were entitled to complain about discipline after reading recent press reports they told us very clearly it was the troops telling the leaders get in line he told bbc radio s today on tuesday mr prescott said there were occasional disagreements in any government but he argued mr blair and mr brown could work successfully together and had produced a strong economy and better public services the new book claims mr prescott hosted a dinner in november where the prime minister told mr brown he would stand down before the next election because he had lost trust over the iraq war he had then changed his mind in june following intervention from cabinet allies and suspicion that the chancellor was manoeuvring against him writes mr peston mr prescott said there was a dinner but the discussions were confidential of course as a waiter for years i have a professional ability here he joked mr blair has insisted he has done no deals over the premiership while mr brown says he will not let gossip distract him from helping a unified election campaign the conservatives say the two men are behaving like squabbling schoolboys and the liberal democrats claim personal ambition is obstructing good government labour mps fears over squabbling if there is one thing certain to stiffen the spines of labour mps it is the prospect of losing their seats at a general election and it was largely that fear that led to tony blair and gordon brown being read the riot act during a meeting of the parliamentary labour party the views expressed by both backbenchers and labour peers over the claimed squabbling between the two men starkly demonstrated the widelyheld view within the labour party that the two most powerful figures in the government are jeopardising the next election as one hugelydisgruntled backbencher said before the meeting it is time they realised its not just my seat they are threatening but if they go on like this they could put the election in doubt it is a sentiment that is now running throughout the labour benches with mps eager to underline the message to their leaders to stop the squabbling and get on with the job at hand as paul flynn said what has deeply upset the party is in this time of all times when we wanted to come together we wanted to lead on the global issues to change politics for the next decade the whole thing was wrecked by a piece of childishness by the two main people in the party two people we greatly respect stephen pound echoed the message saying we know that the one thing that could entirely jeopardise what we are trying to achieve not for the labour party but for this country is the appearance of division we remember the s they backed the suggestion that unless the squabbling stopped the people briefing on behalf of the two men would be named and shamed the dressing down appears to have done the trick with mr brown joining his alleged rival alan milburn who the prime minister put in charge of election planning in mr browns stead and deputy prime minister john prescott at an election poster launch but the effect of all this is to have achieved two things firstly nobody is attempting to suggest any more that the stories of the rift between the chancellor and the prime minister are fictions created by the media and authors even mr prescott admitted that had he still been a backbencher he would have been giving mr blair and mr brown the same message secondly it has also underlined the view that the election campaign has to all intents and purposes kicked off but whether the telling off and the subsequent change in behaviour by the two men will do any good or can even be sustained through the campaign remains to be seen even as the mps were expressing their fears it emerged that while mr brown is in africa for a week the prime minister is to deliver a keynote speech on election themes for a third term and he is expected to repeat his recent insistence that the next manifesto will be new labour through and through similarly some were pointing out that the chancellor during the election poster launch once again refused to deny the claim that he told the prime minister he could never trust anything he said none the less what some believe now is that the effect of the warnings from the backbenchers will actually be to silence the brown camp effectively strengthening the prime ministers hand for example will those brownite briefers suggest their man is unhappy at the prime ministers timing or subject matter as may have been the case in the past what all seem agreed on however is that this sniping simply cannot be allowed to go on through the election campaign mind you we have heard similar pledges before poll idols face first hurdles vote for me itvs pop idol style talent contest for wouldbe politicians finally hits our screens this week over the next four days hundreds of potential candidates will be whittled down by a panel of experts and public vote the winner will then be encouraged to stand as an independent at the next general election which is expected in the spring but opinion is divided on whether any of the potential candidates unearthed so far have got what it takes to make it in politics any of them would make competent mps former independent mp martin bell insisted on bbc radio s today programme mr bell who will be offering his advice to the contestants on wednesday argues that westminster has its share of odd balls and the show will engage ordinary voters if it gets more people voting and more people interested in politics there is no harm in that he said but sir bernard ingham margaret thatchers former press secretary took a less charitable view accusing the programme of corrupting politics he said the producers would not achieve their aim of reengaging voters with that bunch of nutters to give sir bernard his dues monday evenings opening episode did attract more than a smattering of eccentrics and selfpublicists among those chancing their arm were a druid priest and a former porn star who insisted on removing her top to make her point about the legalisation of brothels among the more eccentric policy proposals was a public holiday on bruce forsyths birthday and bill oddie for prime minister the show follows the timehonoured pop idol format with queues of nervous hopefuls and a panel of three experts judging their performance the contestants were given seconds to present their manifestos then the final were tested on their lobbying ability they were then crossexamined by the panel which was chaired by exitn political editor john sergeant with television host lorraine kelly taking the nicki chapman role but the real star of the show is kelvin mackenzie in the simon cowell mr nasty seat the former sun editor dispensed a stream of wellcrafted insults and oneliners his advice for one young contestant was to get a haircut and a brain transplant wheelchair user kevin donnellon was asked why on earth do you want our elected representatives to be disabled dont you care about the inuit implored guitartoting environmental campaigner barry lim i dont care about them i care about myself and when the suns shining i think fantastic replied mr mackenzie mr lim later reduced the panel to fits of giggles as he outlined his plan to make people do community service instead of paying taxes when the prime minister turns to the chancellor and says how much have we got in the coffers mr brown he says well prime minister bad news all the houses in britain have been painted but actually nobody has paid any tax observed mr mackenzie that was an total disaster i just couldnt seem to think of things to say a crestfallen mr lim confided in the shows presenter jonathan maitland irfan hanif a yearold doctor from bolton made a good impression even if he was a little thrown by mr mackenzies suggestion that instead of being treated by the nhs young drunks should given a good beating and left to die dominic carman son of late libel lawyer george carman was voted through to the final on a platform of cutting defence spending to boost education opinion was more divided over rodney hyltonpotts a yearold convicted fraudster mr mackenzie thought the smoothtalking former solicitor with a hardline on crime and immigration deserved a chance to progress he could join the rest of the crooks in the houses of parliament but ms kelly said she would not trust him as far as she could throw him the series continues throughout the week with the public given the chance to evict one prospective mp every night itv will not fund the election campaign for the eventual winner but the publicity could give the winner a flying start over other candidates labour seeks to quell feud talk labours leadership put on a show of unity at a campaign poster launch after mps criticised tony blair and gordon brown over reports of their rift mr brown was joined at the launch by john prescott and alan milburn the man controversially put in charge of election planning by mr blair a private meeting on monday saw normally loyal mps warn that feuding could jeopardise their election hopes it follows a new book charting disputes between prime minister and chancellor the event was the first time mr milburn has shared a platform with the chancellor since taking mr browns traditional poll planning role but the pair chatted amicably and mr brown insisted he was happy with his current campaign task asked about how he would deal with claims that he did not trust the prime minister mr brown replied you can see that our record on the economy is about the british people trusting us to run the economy he refused to comment on the new book saying nobody should be distracted from the business of government mr brown later told reporters of course i trust the prime minister downing street cited that comment when reporters suggested mr brown had pointedly failed to deny claims he had once told mr blair there is nothing you could ever say to me now that i could ever believe labours new posters say britain is enjoying the lowest inflation since the s lowest unemployment for years and the lowest mortgage rates for years they urge voters not to let the tories take things backwards mr milburn promised a poll campaign which is upbeat confident and above all else optimistic about the future of our country conservative cochairman liam fox derided the photo call saying the show of unity was the worst acting i have seen since prisoner cell block h labour had broken promises by raising taxes times and brought the slowest economic growth in the englishspeaking world he said the prime minister and chancellor faced backbench discontent at mondays meeting of the parliamentary labour party over claims made in journalist robert pestons new book mr blair told mps and peers i know from everyone here in cabinet and government nothing is going to get in the way of a unified labour party with a unified position and winning the third term people desperately need labours paul flynn said the pair had had a scorching from mps on tuesday deputy prime minister mr prescott told bbc news they told us very clearly it was the troops telling the leaders get in line the new book claims mr prescott hosted a dinner in november where the prime minister told mr brown he would stand down before the next election because he had lost trust over the iraq war mr blair then changed his mind in june after cabinet allies intervened and amid suspicion the chancellor was manoeuvring against him writes mr peston mr prescott said there was a dinner but the discussions were confidential of course as a waiter for years i have a professional ability here he joked labours election lovein peace and love have been in short supply in the labour party in recent days if press reports are to be believed alan milburn and gordon brown have been at each others throats over the contents of labours next election manifesto but the pair were all smiles on tuesday morning as they joined john prescott to unveil labours latest poster campaign the event at old billingsgate fish market on the banks of the thames was a carefully choreographed show of unity and the surest sign yet that we are heading for a general election in the next few months it was also one of the most bizarre photo opportunities of recent years the first inkling something slightly odd was afoot was when in place of the soft rock music normally chosen for such occasions labours speakers crackled to life with the sound of booker t and the mgs then a vw camper van trundled into view decked out in that most mindbending of psychedelic messages lowest mortgage rate for years as the sidedoor slid open it looked for one glorious moment as if the cabinet had decided to bury their differences and go on the road together scooby doostyle but sadly it wasnt the cabinet who had raided the dressingup box just six rather illatease looking labour students two were dressed as regency dandies to unveil a poster trumpeting the longest period of economic growth for years another pair of students were in a beatle wig and sgt pepper jacket to highlight the lowest interest rates since the s the remaining two were dressed in a vague approximation of disco chic to demonstrate the lowest unemployment since the seventies the politicians led out by john prescott were soberlysuited as always the event may have been designed to highlight labours economic success under mr brown but there was little doubt who was in charge the chancellor walked sidebyside with mr milburn pointedly exchanging chit chat as they approached the microphone but it was mr milburn who took centre stage speaking of the positive campaign the party hoped to stage in the coming weeks and months the mobile poster vans would let people know britain is working again mr brown repeated the familiar mantras displayed on the posters and spoke of labours shared purpose and united dedication it was left to mr prescott to pay glowing tribute to the chancellors record and in a final flourish to produce his famous pledge card from claiming labour has met all of its promises the event was carefully stagemanaged to underline cabinet unity and more specifically to demonstrate the central role mr brown will play in the election campaign despite being sidelined as campaign chief in favour of mr milburn but keen students of body language will have had a field day there was much forced smiling for the cameras but only mr prescott who revels in such occasions seemed to be truly enjoying himself mr milburn made a point of turning to face the chancellor as he spoke nodding thoughtfully but it was the former health secretarys final gesture placing an arm on mr browns back as they walked away from the microphones which was perhaps the most telling thanks for dropping by gordon he might have been saying howard taunts blair over splits tony blairs feud with gordon brown is damaging the way the uk is governed tory leader michael howard has claimed in a heated prime ministers questions mr howard asked how can they fight crime when they are fighting each other that question was later unveiled as the headline for new tory campaign posters but mr blair dismissed the talk of splits and said peoples priorities at the next elections would be on the economic successes achieved by labour he can stick up whatever he likes on billboards about something in a book but what the public will concentrate on are the low mortgages low inflation low unemployment that we delivered and that he failed to he said the chancellor is currently on a highprofile tour of africa to highlight new antipoverty plans but before doing so he insisted he still trusted mr blair despite claims to the contrary in a new book browns britain by robert peston says there is mutual animosity between the two men it claims mr blair said in november he would stand down as prime minister before the next election but he went back on his pledge after support from cabinet allies and suspicion that mr brown was manoeuvring against him it says mr pestons book claimed that mr brown told mr blair there is nothing you could ever say to me now that i could ever believe mr blair directly denied that quote on wednesday he again insisted there could be no deals about the premiership but twice declined directly to say whether or not he had offered to quit the tory leader countered that such agreements had been struck twice at dinners with the chancellor he declared he is the deals on meals prime minister no wonder the chancellor is not a happy eater he continued how can there be discipline in schools when there is no discipline in government how can they clean up our hospitals when they dont clean up their act mr blair said he would not respond to tittle tattle in books and promised to hail labours record on the economy waiting lists and law and order from now until polling day later at their poster launch tory cochairman liam fox said his party would exploit opportunities to show how juvenile the prime minister and chancellor were labour staged a show of unity at its own poster launch on tuesday where mr brown was joined by alan milburn who mr blair controversially put in charge of election planning in place of the chancellor but liberal democrat leader charles kennedy told bbc news the government is clearly split at the top this kind of cosmetic exercise does not persuade anybody later this week mr blair is expected to outline the direction of his partys next election manifesto the prime minister and chancellor faced backbench discontent at mondays meeting of the parliamentary labour party over claims made mr pestons book blair looks to election campaign tony blairs big speech will be looked back on as the performance that kicked off the election campaign that poll may still be about weeks away but there can be little doubt left that the campaign is now in full swing the prime minister used his speech to a selected audience in the south east to set out his broad brush election manifesto there was a detailed account of the governments past record with a major emphasis on the economy and public services there was an attempt to draw the line under the gossip surrounding his rift with chancellor gordon brown and there was an insistence on the importance of the party continuing to operate as unremittingly new labour although that may continue to irritate his chancellor there was little in terms of concrete proposals or what might form manifesto pledges although the prime minister talked about a new labour manifesto that will be aimed at all sections of society his was more a speech designed to remind people and some in his own party precisely what new labour stood for and to leave them in no doubt there would not be any shrinking away from that approach and for some that means showing that new labour actually does stand for something that it is as he said more than an electoral device to that end he set out a broad programme aimed to appeal to both middle england voters who switched to the party in and stuck with it possibly through some gritted teeth in and to more traditional lower income old labour supporters in a key section he declared in our third term we can achieve an unprecedented widening of opportunity and prosperity for the first time ever a whole generation growing up with unbroken economic stability every family not just the fortunate few knowing their children will have an inheritance at adulthood every pupil in every secondary school guaranteed a place in university or a quality apprenticeship every adult including those who missed out at school able to get the skills then need to advance home ownership extended to its highest ever level and to families who have never before been able to afford it the highest ever level of employment with everyone in work guaranteed a decent wage and decent conditions under what is to be the general election slogan britain is working the prime minister time and again insisted the future direction would be unremittingly new labour that might get under the skin of mr brown but he also heaped praise on him as the most successful postwar chancellor britain has had probably the greatest ideological divide between the two men in so far as there is one is about the degree of private finance allowed into the public services an unremittingly new labour manifesto as the prime minister is happy to make plain will stress the importance of that the belief patients and parents for example want a choice of good services before they start worrying about who has provided them the chancellor is said to be far more sceptical about private finance although there is no suggestion he opposes it in principle with an election looming the next big speech from gordon brown will be closely examined for any signs of divisions and in particular the use of that little three letter word but for now all eyes have been focused on the next general election and for many in westminster mr blairs performance has only succeeded in hardening the belief that will be on may tories unveil quango blitz plans plans to abolish quangos have been unveiled by the conservatives as part of their effort to show how government red tape can be cut six government units would also be scrapped under proposals which the tories say would save more than bn among the targets are strategic health authorities and the new fair access regulator for universities tory frontbencher john redwood said britain needed a slimmer government and lower taxes to be competitive the plans would abolish regional assemblies and other regional bodies such as boards tackling industrial development and housing their powers would be returned to elected local councils or national government the tories say the strategic health authorities are not needed as it is better that local people rather than officials run hospitals and surgeries announcing the plans mr redwood said mr blair has forgotten the interests of taxpayers and has broken the pledges he made far from improving public services spending taxpayers money on quangos has led only to more bureaucrats more regulation and higher taxes his party leader michael howard argued a change in direction was needed to get a grip on spending labour are creating two britains the britain of the forgotten majority and bureaucratic britain he said in the real world people are working harder just to stand still theyve seen their pensions knocked for six theyre being squeezed by extra taxes the forgotten majority are paying the price of bureaucratic britain the government has announced plans to cut civil servants as part of its efficiency drive but chief secretary to the treasury paul boateng attacked the tory plans the conservatives are committed to cutting labours public spending plans by a massive billion he said cuts on this scale cannot be found from cutting bureaucracy but would require massive cuts to frontline public services such as schools hospitals and the police the liberal democrats have said they would cut the number of whitehall departments to make sure money reaches frontline services ukips secret weapon by any measure new yorker dick morris is that thing americans love over everything else a winner this is the man who some pundits believe was almost singlehandedly responsible for bill clintons sensational comeback victory but morris is no ideologue he has worked as election strategist for any number of republicans as well and more recently politicians from mexico to uruguay now he is back in london as the uk independence partys notsosecret electoral weapon after returning from the ukraine where he helped you guessed it opposition candidate viktor yushchenko if there is one regular criticism levelled at morris it is that he is too ready to switch allegiances that he enjoys the game more than the politics so why britain and why ukip which despite its recent eu election successes is not likely to pull off a sensational victory in the looming general election on this subject morris appears almost evangelical i was on a cruise in the mediterranean and coincidentally so was ukip leader roger knapman i had just written a piece saying how the english channel was now wider than the atlantic which he liked and it went from there but what is it about ukip that particularly attracts him many might think it is simply another chance to practice his art irrespective of the politics i think the greatest threat to democracy in the world is not terrorism but bureaucratism a great soundbite but a surprise coming from a new yorker post september it is the growth of these bodies composed of experts who know better who dont believe in letting democracy govern but believe in letting the correct solution be determined thats international bankers the world trade organisation the international monetary fund the world bank and primarily the european union so he is out to help ukip take britain out of this organisation which he believes is unreformable and inherently undemocratic and he is scathing of the tory party which he also appears to believe is unreformable the tory party is schizophrenic about europe but until somebody says they are willing to leave the eu they cant possibly renegotiate anything as michael howard is pledged to do its like walking into a liquor store with a gun to rob it and saying before i can proceed with the robbery i want to make clear i am not going to shoot anybody possibly a very american analogy but another great soundbite the basic point is that the eu seeks political integration to move the entire nexus of decision making away from britain and we oppose that and the tories cannot be trusted to oppose it so is ukips job to destroy the tories as former member robert kilroysilk once notoriously declared no the aim of ukip is to withdraw from the eu and if it has any relation to the tories it is to stiffen the tories spine on the issue by having a large enough ukip vote so that we move the tories in the direction they are refusing to move but its not just to shift the tories i think ukip had a huge amount to do with tony blairs decision to hold a referendum on the european constitution and i think it had a huge amount to do with his refusal to go into the euro and while we are on the subject of mr kilroysilk mr morris despatches him with another of his neat soundbites robert kilroy silk is not a team player it is a good idea our party stands for some thing and not some one so what is the big plan for the general election how will he achieve the breakthrough look we are not going to be forming the next government he said neither does ukip have to fight every seat as with the us presidential election he says the outcome will be decided by a small number of swing seats just as he believes it will in britain so with limited resources the aim is to target those seats and end the day with a significant group in the commons he also believes it is possible the internet could have a big part in the poll the internet was a decisive factor in the presidential election through blogs individuals posting their views in online diaries people just did it anything can happen in the next general election there is an inherent instability at the moment labour and the tories have drawn the consensus so tightly and to the left there is room for another voice that might he suggests lead to a hung parliament with ukip and others holding the balance of power it is a huge task surely but there is undoubtedly a sense that the next general election may indeed produce some surprises even while most still believe it is labours for the taking ukips performance in last years european elections was just such a shocker and showed that mr morris may have a point about the new consensus and after all he has a reputation to sustain tory leader unveils spending plan tory leader michael howard says his party can save bn in government spending by tackling waste the money would be ploughed back into frontline services like the nhs and schools with the rest used to cut government borrowing and reduce taxes the tory leader has also shrugged off the defection of one of his mps robert jackson a former minister to labour mr howard said that these things happened in politics and it would not affect the outcome of the election lets be realistic the election is not going to be decided on the basis of what mr jackson did he told bbc s breakfast with frost programme however the defection on saturday has cast a shadow over the launch of the conservatives spending plans fuller details are due to be unveiled on monday the bulk of the bn saved by tackling bureaucracy and inefficient systems will go back into frontline services mr howard said the bn left over would then be spent on reducing government borrowing he added however the remainder would deal with some of the unfair taxes almost every independent expert says if you get another labour government you are going to have to pay higher taxes mr howard insisted because borrowing is going up it is out of control that is bound to lead to higher taxes or higher interest rates or both so part of the bn we are going to apply to filling the governments black hole reducing the borrowing the rest will be used to reduce these unfair taxes which are bearing so heavily on the people of our country today mr howard is expected to say that around bn will be available for tax cuts when he makes his announcement on monday the cuts will be paid for out of the savings identified by business troubleshooter david james home office spending could be cut by bn according to the final instalment of his yearlong review savings of m at the foreign office and m at the department for culture media and sport have also been identified in all almost a quarter of a million jobs and public bodies would go under mr james proposals mr howard said all this adds up to a bottom line and the bottom line is at this election people will have a clear choice between mr blair who will waste more and tax more and a conservative government that will give them value for money and tax less however chief treasury secretary paul boateng said none of the tories figures add up so they cant make these savings and cant pay for any tax cuts which means the only guaranteed cut from the tories is bn of cuts hitting frontline public services hard liberal democrat leader charles kennedy added people will not be taken in by michael howards claims of bn worth of savings this cant be achieved without drastic cuts in local services in their own communities a poll for the news of the world newspaper suggests the conservatives are on course for their worst election defeat in a century labour will hold key marginal constituencies winning a majority of the populus survey suggests and the liberal democrats will take three key seats from the conservatives leaving the tories with just mps two less than they returned atlabours landslide and their worst showing since kennedy looks to election gains they may not know quite how to describe their position in british politics the real opposition the valid opposition the effective opposition or the authentic opposition but the liberal democrats are entering the expected election campaign determined to prove it is they not the tories who are now the real threat to labour as tory leader michael howard kicked off his election campaign the lib dem leader charles kennedy dismissed the conservatives as a fading force and he insisted there was no limit to his partys ambitions in the coming poll and he can produce some pretty impressive recent election results to back up his optimism for an election which he believes might just see his party doing big things sensible third party leaders are usually cautious about making any predictions about how they will do come the big test and mr kennedy was not falling into that trap when he fired up his campaign from the partys westminster hq he would make no predictions other than that he expected the lib dems to increase both their votes and their commons seats at the election the gap between labour and the tories was now so narrow as proved he claimed by the defection to labour of robert jackson that only his party offered a genuine alternative on the war on iraq identity cards student fees and the council tax there was nothing to chose between the two big parties whereas the liberal democrats offered costed sensible alternatives he was also happy to break the two party consensus on taxation by promising to increase income tax on those earning more than a year to pay for the scrapping of student fees the introduction of free personal care for the elderly and replacing the council tax with a local income tax he was also happy to offer a pledge that he would be doing no deals to prop up either of the other big parties after the election there was a time when such optimistic sounds coming from the third party could be dismissed as selfdelusion that is no longer the case with the liberal democrats the other parties will still insist that the lib dems are no hopers whose greatest effect on the poll will be to boost the hopes of their opponents by denying them otherwise winnable seats labour in particular fears that disillusioned supporters may switch to the lib dems allowing the tories to win some seats but mr kennedy is clearly hoping for a more significant outcome than that he will not talk about the big breakthrough although there are those who believe this could well be the election that sees his party crossing some sort of symbolic threshold they would argue that by the time of the election after next the liberal democrats may genuinely have replaced the tories as the party challenging labour for power the lib dems will hope to have made advances because of their consistent stand against the war on iraq but mr kennedy believes his new manifesto will also offer sensible costed and achievable policies on things like the council tax crime and asylum that will underpin his claim that his party really is the only opposition worth the name best person for top legal job the best person for the job should be appointed lord chancellor and not necessarily a lawyer or mp the courts minister has told mps under reforms the post of lord chancellor is to be stripped of its judicial functions the lord chancellorno more needs to be a lawyer than the secretary of health needs to be a doctor said courts minister christopher leslie the constitutional reform bill was entering its second reading on monday mr leslie said the prime minister should be able to appoint the best person for the job whether they sit in the house of lords or the house of commons under the reforms the law lords will also be replaced as the uks highest legal authority by a supreme court and judges will be appointed by an independent panel rather than ministers in december the lords rejected a plea by current lord chancellor lord falconer that the holder of the job should not necessarily be a lawyer or a peer the peers voted by to to say in law that lord chancellors must also be peers the debate was carried over from the last parliamentary session but with an impending general election time is crucial for the government to get the bill passed mr leslie said it was irrelevant whether the post was called secretary of state for constitutional affairs or lord chancellor he said what matters most iswhether it is reformed so that the post holder no longer has those conflicting duties it is no longer appropriate for a government minister to have such unfettered discretion in the appointment of judges shadow attorney general dominic grieve criticised the government on its plans to change what he said was an exceptional institution providing a champion of the independence of the judiciary the government had initially proposed to take this institution and smash it to pieces mr grieve said convention should be nurtured and celebrated but the government distrusted and disliked it instead he warned that unless ministers backed down over the lord chancellor remaining a member of the house of lords the government would have great difficulty in getting the bill through parliament former cabinet minister douglas hogg whose father and grandfather served as lord chancellor said the bill was largely unnecessary bureaucratic and expensive but the tory mp for sleaford and north hykeham admitted the lord chancellors role and office cannot be frozen in aspic the memory driving browns mission the memory gordon brown says keeps returning to him the one that he says is burnt into him is that of a yearold girl whose parents died of aids and who is hiv positive herself mr brown seems haunted by her eyes desolate of all hope and then he talks of those eyes that do inspire optimism an extraordinary performance by schoolgirls of kenyas largest slum advancing with crowded menace flicking their hips in a manner almost as disturbing before the finale of a clenched fist salute and shout of free education free education for all mr browns message generally that compassion must become action before that hope is squandered but he is such a pivotal figure in british politics it is almost impossible not to ask him why he is doing this his answer in part is because of the missionaries that used to come to his fathers church ever since he says africa has been important to him ive absolutely no doubt whatsoever this is heartfelt but he also believes it is time for the world to see a new gordon brown not the dull reassuring bank manager but a man driven by a moral passion and it just so happens the labour party feels an awful lot happier ridding the world of debt than ridding the world of dictators theres also a sense of liberation if mr blair wont allow him to run the election campaign then he can at least pretend it was all getting tedious and hed much rather be out examining social problems in the raw it also goes some way to solving one of the overarching problems for all politicians of all parties scepticism sliding into cynicism about politics itself if he can help the worlds poor just a little then it shows politics isnt worthless but is his vision for africa too grand can poverty in the continent really be halved brown replies that no one thought the berlin wall would ever come down either hes still got to overcome not only the reluctance of other finance ministers in the world but also the cynicism of experts who wonder whether debt relief will just be squandered by governments that just wont in the end spend wisely howard dismisses tory tax fears michael howard has dismissed fears from some conservatives that his plans for bn tax cuts are too modest he defended the package saying it was a plan for the tories first budget and he hoped to be able to go further the tories on monday highlighted bn in wasteful spending they would stop to allow tax cuts reduced borrowing and more spending on key services labour and the liberal democrats say the partys sums do not add up and claim it would cut frontline services the tory tax plan follows complaints from some of the partys mps that mr howard and shadow chancellor oliver letwin have taken too long to unveil the proposals now they have promised a figure but have yet to reveal which taxes would be targeted tory backbencher edward leigh said the proposals were a step in the right direction but he told the financial times i would come up sooner with much greater tax cuts interviewed on bbc radio s jeremy vine show mr howard said it is perfectly true that i am being attacked on one side by people who think we ought to be promising much much bigger tax cuts and spending cuts on the other side there are people who say we wont be able to achieve these tax cuts i think we have got it about right mr howard said voters faced a clear choice at the next election between more waste and more tax under labour and tory value for money and lower taxes he added i would like to be able to do more and over time i am sure we will be able to do more but at the start we have got to recognise there is a limit to what we can do in one go in our first budget i have got to be responsible about this the latest tory plans came as campaigning for the election widely expected in may gathered pace the liberal democrats launched their preelection platform with leader charles kennedy saying his party was the authentic opposition particularly on the iraq war council tax and university tuition fees lib dem treasury spokesman vince cable also branded the tory plans as fantasy economics labour hit back at the tory proposals even before their publication with election coordinator alan milburn accusing mr howard of producing a fraudulent prospectus the party on tuesday challenged the tories to publish the full report from david james the troubleshooter they asked to identify possible savings but the tories are in turn demanding that tony blair spell out which taxes he would raise if he wins the election donor attacks blairbrown feud the reported feud between tony blair and gordon brown has prompted a labour donor to say he will almost certainly refuse to give more funds duncan bannatyne also attacked the government over iraq and its poor response to the asian tsunami crisis his broadside came as exforeign secretary robin cook said he hoped mr brown would be premier at some point mr bannatyne has previously given labour he made his fortune from care homes and health clubs the yearold on tuesday said was he was reviewing his donations because of cabinet disunity and international issues his spokesman said it was highly unlikely he would give labour more money although he would remain a supporter and not fund the conservatives robert pestons new book has prompted more speculation about the blairbrown rift with its claims that the prime minister broke a promise made in to stand down mr bannatyne said disunity in the cabinet has a corrosive effect on the country gordon brown is a great chancellor who has delivered a stable economy but business wants that to continue and not be blown off course by petty squabbles based on personal ambition the businessman whose latest venture is a casino in newcastle also voiced concern about the ongoing violence in iraq and he branded the uk governments response to the tsunami as piecemeal and poor the people there need practical help not just pledges of money he said the us has forces helping on the ground we can do more british navy ships have helped the relief effort and the prime minister has said the government could ultimately give hundreds of millions of pounds in aid mr bannatyne is due to host a new television programme and is also appearing on bbc business startup programme dragons den but his spokesman insisted his attack on labour was not a publicity stunt in a separate development robin cook gave his support to mr browns prime ministerial ambitions but told a lunch for political journalists winning the election had to be labours election but he insisted the recent squabbles between mr blair and mr brown were not perceived as a problem by the voters adding there was no impression of governmental incompetence mr cook argued that more prominence was given to these matters because there was not an alternative source of opposition to the government he warned the abstentions party was the real challenge to labour and they would not be motivated by mr blairs promise to produce an unremittingly new labour election manifesto his comments come after dave prentis the leader of britains biggest union unison told the daily record newspaper he wants a date to be set for mr blair to be replaced as labour leader howard and blair tax pledge clash tony blair has said voters will have to wait for labours manifesto to see if the party has plans to increase tax the premier was responding to a challenge from tory leader michael howard who said labour would raise taxes in its postelection budget mr blair derided tory claims they could cut bn in wasteful spending saying the party had got its sums wrong the two political leaders clashed just days after the opening salvoes of the preelection period mr howard told mps that every independent expert from the international monetary fund to the institute of fiscal studies had suggested the government was spending more than it is raising and a labour chancellor would have to put up taxes mr blair replied i think they are wrong for this very simple reason that the treasury forecasts on the economy have been proven right the tories on monday highlighted their plans for tax cuts worth bn although the specific taxes to be cut have not been announced they also spelled out their plans for reduced government borrowing and more spending on key services labour and the liberal democrats have said the partys sums do not add up and claim it would cut frontline services but mr howard said voters faced a clear choice at the next election between more waste and more tax under labour and tory value for money and lower taxes the liberal democrats have also launched their preelection platform with leader charles kennedy saying his party was the authentic opposition particularly on the iraq war council tax and university tuition fees labour hit back at the tory proposals even before their publication with election coordinator alan milburn accusing mr howard of producing a fraudulent prospectus what really divides the parties so what is the gap between labour and the tories nowadays one starbucks one rymans and one small greek cafe as it happens both parties have now completed their moves to new headquarters with labour creating its election hub just three doors away from the tories new headquarters in victoria street just down the road from the commons that should make things a little easier if and when the crackofdawn election press conferences kick off unlike there should be no need for colleagues to have taxis gunning their engines outside or to buy scooters to get themselves between the tightlytimetabled events and to all intents and purposes we already appear to be in that general election campaign certainly the press conference hosted by election coordinator alan milburn in the rather compact new conference room still smelling of new carpet and with the garish new labour coffee mugs as yet unstained had all the hallmarks of an election event welcome to the unremittingly new labour media centre he said and ill bet he hadnt checked that one with gordon brown along with work and pensions secretary alan johnson and minister for work jane kennedy he then went on to tear into the tory plans to scrap the new deal welfaretowork scheme which they claimed would lead to an increase of almost in unemployment and they ridiculed the claims made on monday by michael howard that he could save billion of labour waste and inefficiency to spend on public services while also offering billion of tax cuts labour has come up with a figure of billions worth of efficiency savings so understandably perhaps believe mr howard must be planning cuts to squeeze the extra billion these figures based on the two parties own detailed studies will be battered to within an inch of their lives during the campaign wednesday was just the start amnesty chief laments war failure the lack of public outrage about the war on terror is a powerful indictment of the failure of human rights groups amnesty internationals chief has said in a lecture at the london school of economics irene khan said human rights had been flouted in the name of security since september she said the human rights movement had to use simpler language both to prevent scepticism and spread a moral message and it had to fight poverty not just focus on political rights for elites ms khan highlighted detentions without trial including those at the us camp at guantanamo bay in cuba and the abuse of prisoners as evidence of increasing human rights problems whats a new challenge is the way in which this ageold debate on security and human rights has been translated into the language of war she said by using the language of war human rights are being sidelined because we know human rights do not apply in times of war ms khan said such breaches were infectious and were now seen in almost very major country in the world the human rights movement faces a crisis of faith in the value of human rights she said that was accompanied by a crisis of governance where the united nations system did not seem able to hold countries to account the amnesty secretarygeneral said a growing gap between the perceived influence of human rights group and what they could actually achieve was fuelling scepticism public passivity on the war against terror is the single most powerful indictment on the failures of human rights groups she said ms khan said the movement had failed to mobilise public outrage about what was happening to the human rights system there needed to be a drive to use simpler language talking about the basic morality of the issues rather than the complexity of legal processes such efforts could make the issues more relevant to people across the world she said the human rights groups also had to recognise there were new groups which had to be tackled in new ways as power dripped away from state governments alqaeda for example was not going to be impressed by a traditional amnesty letter writing campaign more also needed to be done to develop a human rights framework for international business corporations amnesty international members voted in to extend the organisations work from political and civil rights to cover social and economic rights too ms khan said the human rights movement would make itself irrelevant if it turned away from the suffering caused by economic strife we would be an elitist bunch working for the elites for those who cannot read the newspaper of their choice rather than those who cannot read she said despite her concerns ms khan dubbed herself a hopemonger saying she was confident the passions of the human rights movement could overcome the new challenges blair sees greater bush consensus george w bush will display a more consensual approach to world politics as he begins his second term as us president tony blair has said the prime minister said mr bush had learned military force was not the only way to fight terrorism he understood that the best prospect of peaceful coexistence lies in the spread of democracy and human rights mr blair told the guardian newspaper mr bush was sworn in at a ceremony in washington dc on thursday echoing the new us secretary of state condoleezza rice the prime minister said there has been a clear evolution of us policy since the war in afghanistan in mr blair had personally seen the change over time in conversations with mr bush the president understood that while military and security measures were important there also needed to be a multilateral approach to solving the worlds problems turning to critics fears that the us was poised for further military action mr blair refused to give succour to suggestions it was preparing for strikes against iran the prime minister conceded that the us had what appears to be a harder position towards the state than europe but the prime minister pointed out that until now the us had allowed britain france and germany to take the lead in trying to halt the iranian nuclear programme following claims that us forces had worked inside iran to identify potential targets mr blair was asked if the sas had also been in the country we never answer questions about special forces but do not take that as indicating an affirmative said mr blair mr blair said he believed the president was keen to work with other countries while trying to spread democracy and human rights it is significant in my view that he is coming to europe as his first foreign visit said mr blair following his inauguration mr bush is due in europe at the end of january kilroysilk quits shameful ukip exchat show host robert kilroysilk has quit the uk independence party and accused it of betraying its supporters the mep said he was ashamed to have joined the party which he labelled as a joke he plans to stand in the next general election but refused to confirm he is setting up a new political party called veritas latin for truth ukip leader roger knapman said he would break open the champagne adding it was nice knowing him now goodbye however he did say the exchat show host had been quite useful initially he has remarkable ability to influence people but sadly after the european election it became clear that he was more interested in the robert kilroysilk party than the uk independence party so it was nice knowing him now goodbye mr knapman told bbc radio s today programme mr knapman rejected the idea mr kilroysilk posed a threat to ukip and queried why he had failed to confirm rumours he was starting a new political party mr kilroysilk explained his reasons to his east midlands constituents at a meeting in hinckley leicestershire his decision came as ukip officials began a process which could have triggered mr kilroysilks expulsion it marks the end of his membership of ukip after just nine months it began with a flood of publicity which helped ukip into third place in last junes european elections but became dominated by rancour as he tried to take over the party leadership mr kilroysilk accused his fellow ukip meps of being content with growing fat sitting on their backsides in brussels he told bbc news i tried to change the party i nagged all the way through the summer to do things to get moving because i thought it was criminal what they were doing it was a betrayal mr kilroysilk also told sky news there was masses of support for him to form a new party something he has yet to confirm will happen ukip won seats and of the vote at the european elections on the back of its call for the uk to leave the european union in his speech mr kilroysilk says the result offered ukip an amazing opportunity but the partys leadership had done nothing and gone awol there were no policies no energy no vision and no spokespeople he said the party is going nowhere and im embarrassed with its allies in europe and im ashamed to be a member of the party said mr kilroysilk he said his conviction in britains right to govern itself had not changed he would continue that campaign outside ukip when he contested the general election in an east midlands constituency reports of his new party plans have prompted a formal complaint to ukips disciplinary committee for bringing the party into disrepute on thursday the party challenged mr kilroysilk to stand down as an mep so voters can get a genuine ukip candidate blair blasts tory spending plans tony blair has launched an attack on conservative spending plans saying they are a ludicrous improbability the prime minister has told a labour party gathering that the tory policies would cause economic failure tory leader michael howard has said his party would cut bn in wasteful spending to allow bn in tax cuts on saturday tory shadow home secretary david davis said the tories would fund the cuts by removing inefficiencies which had burgeoned under labour in his speech mr blair contrasted a reformed labour party which had learned to occupy the political centre ground with a hidebound tory party which he said would turn the clock back with spending cuts mr blair said the conservative tax and spending proposals would put at risk both britains hardwon economic stability the lowest mortgages inflation unemployment for decades and the key investment in public services i believe that the tory plans are as plain a call to return to the past as its possible to imagine he said its a recipe for exactly the same boom and bust economics and cuts in public services that were their hallmark in years of conservative government mr blair added they the conservatives have learned nothing by contrast he said new labour had listened to its electorate and changed mr blair went on to list his governments achievements and to issue a rallying call to the party so now we have a choice we can defend this record and we can build on it and go on and fulfil the promise or give up and go back and i say we have to fight in response david davis said the tories would make cuts such as removing regional assemblies but would bring in more police officers and match labours spending on health and education everybody knows having lived through this government the last seven years that they faced lots of stealth tactics lots of increases in taxes but no improvement in public services he said mr davis said labour had been responsible for huge waste huge overspending not on the frontline at all but on bureaucracy the public face a choice between more waste and more taxes with this government less waste and lower taxes with a tory government he concluded gordon brown has addressed the conference behind closed doors the chancellor said the conservatives plans would see some bn in spending cuts by which the tories deny mr brown also issued call for party unity and warn of the dangers of allowing themselves to be distracted or diverted according to an advance text released by officials he told delegates we must all show the strength and unity of purpose to take the longterm decisions necessary to meet them mr brown warned that the tories were planning the biggest cuts ever in the history of any election manifesto meanwhile tory shadow chancellor oliver letwin accused mr blair of misrepresenting the partys proposals and questioned how labour would fund its own plans he still cannot accept the simple truth which is that we will spend more on what matters to people schools hospitals and police and that we will offer value for money and lower taxes mr letwin said once again mr blair and his chancellor have failed to answer the question that lies at the heart of this election which taxes will they put up to fill the bn shortfall in their plans lib dems bold election policy charles kennedy has told voters his liberal democrats will offer them an honest choice at the next general election with the other two big parties battling over which will impose the lowest taxes mr kennedy is going into the looming election pledged to increase taxation it is a bold policy and certainly ensures there is that choice between the lib dems and the other two with his partys previous pledge to increase taxes by one penny in the pound to spend on public services already adopted by the government he has switched tack now he is promising to levy a modest increase of the same amount on earnings over a year to allow him to finance a series of pledges they are to scrap student fees finance free long term care for the elderly and replace the council tax with a local income tax that last policy will also see about of the most well off paying more while others pensioners in particular will pay less labour and the tories have attacked his policies as both unworkable and not properly costed inevitably they insist there is no need to raise taxes to fund improvements in services the tories claim they can improve services and cut taxes through bn efficiency savings while labour has offered bn savings but has yet to map out precise tax proposals although there is little chance they will propose increases in many ways the argument between the lib dems and the others over taxation and spending echo the sort of arguments that raged between labour and the tories in the s and early s but unlike the old torylabour debate he believes voters are ready to see modest tax increases on the well off in order to fund improvements in services that is a view partly endorsed by recent polls suggesting people would rather have cash spent on public services than tax cuts similarly there is a different tone to the lib dem approach to asylum and immigration with mr kennedy stressing politicians should not foment an artificial debate about immigration and attacking michael howards proposals for quotas once again with the two other big parties singing similar songs on immigration mr kennedy is stressing the different more liberal approach of his party mr kennedy was also in buoyant mood over his partys election chances declaring the tories were not going to be significant players in the poll he repeated his pledge not to do postelection deals with either party after the election mr kennedy went on to suggest the reelection of a labour government with a small majority would amount to a massive vote of no confidence in tony blairs government that suggests the lib dem leader believes he may well find himself in a powerful even pivotal position in a vastly different house of commons after the next election it is a dream the third party has dreamed many times before hague given up his pm ambition former conservative leader william hague says he will not stand for the leadership again having given up his ambition to be prime minister mr hague told the daily telegraph he would now find a life dominated by politics too boring and unfulfilling mr hague who stepped down after his partys election defeat does not rule out a return to the front bench he also told the paper he hopes to remain mp for richmond north yorks and start a family with wife ffion mr hague who recently had published the biography of william pitt the younger also said he wanted to continue writing books and speechwriting he told the newspaper i dont know whether i will ever go back on to the front but dont rush me asked if he would stand for the leadership again mr hague replied no definitely not his determination to stay away from a central role will disappoint some senior conservative members who say the party needs him tim collins the shadow education secretary said last week it would be a huge boost to the party if mr hague returned to the front bench mr hague became an mp at and leader of the opposition at he said i feel fortunate that by the age of i had crammed in an entire political career i had been in the cabinet and been leader of the party so now i can branch out into other thingsit is a very liberating feeling mr hague added that he may have misjudged his own ambition to be prime minister maybe i wasnt as driven by politics as i thought i was he said ukip candidate suspended in probe eurosceptic party ukip have suspended a candidate for allegedly suggesting the criminally insane should be killed john houston was due to stand in the east kilbride seat in lanarkshire at the next election but he was suspended after his reported views including the return of the british empire were sent to two scottish newspapers ukip spokesman mark croucher said those who selected mr houston knew nothing of his views the episode comes at a difficult time for ukip soon after the highprofile departure of mep robert kilroysilk mr houston is alleged to have said that the organs of the criminally insane should be made available to lawabiding members of the community and proposed the legalisation of drugs and the sex trade the document reportedly said were looking for the resurrection of the british empire the problems for the human race environmental and others can only be dealt with on a global scale and that calls for a radical alliance of the englishspeaking nations which they are uniquely able to do mr croucher said the main issue would be that mr houstons reported views had been presented as ukip policy which they were not he said they might have been submissions to a committee working on the partys manifesto but would not have been matched to mr houston when he was standing to become a candidate he told bbc news he appears to have said these things we have suspended him as a member and as a candidate by all accounts none of this was mentioned at his selection meeting it is simply a distraction from the task in hand the eu constitution not individual idiocies mr houston was quoted in the herald newspaper saying i feel ukip have overreacted and overshot the runway peter nielson who is ukip scotland chairman said he had suspended mr houston on friday night he will remain suspended while the matter is being investigated and then we will decide if and what further action will be taken he said that any evidence would be looked into and mr houston may be interviewed by the party he added i cant comment too much at the moment i have one version from him but i havent seen the papers yet boothroyd calls for lords speaker betty boothroyd has said the house of lords needs its own speaker and that peers should lead the way on reforming the upper chamber baroness boothroyd who was the first woman to be commons speaker said she believed tony blair initiated reforms without a clear outcome in mind now we have to take care of it ourselves and make the best of it she told the bbcs breakfast with frost in labour removed all but of the lords hereditary peers that was billed as the first stage of reform of the institution the lord chancellor hinted further reforms could be unveiled in the next labour manifesto i think we need to look very carefully at the relationship between the lords and the commons lord falconer told bbcs breakfast with frost how it interacts with the commons is a very very important issue we need to address the issue in the manifesto but you will have to wait for when the manifesto comes the lord chancellor currently has the role of house of lords speaker he is also head of the judiciary and a member of the cabinet as constitutional affairs secretary lady boothroyd said she believed it was unacceptable for the lord chancellor to have the role of speaker i would really like to see a speaker of the house of lords she said i dont go for the idea of somebody a lord chancellor who is head of the judiciary a senior cabinet minister and speaker of the lords i want somebody there who is going to look after that house and do a job there new ukip defection to veritas the uk independence party has lost one of its two london assembly members to robert kilroysilks new political party expected to launch on wednesday damian hockney said exchatshow host mr kilroysilk

of london ukip were also planning to jump ship details of the coming weeks events were hammered out at a meeting at mr kilroysilks buckinghamshire home on sunday the bbc news website was told the news came after ukip suspended a candidate for allegedly suggesting the criminally insane should be killed john houston was due to stand in the east kilbride seat in lanarkshire at the next election a spokesman for ukip called on mr hockney to quit the london assembly ukip asserts that mr hockney has a moral obligation if not a legal one to stand down mr hockney meanwhile told the bbc i believe that robert kilroysilk can deliver better as a leader of a eurosceptic party than the current leadership of the uk independence party on the suspension of mr houston ukip said those who selected him knew nothing of his views mr houston is alleged to have said that the organs of the criminally insane should be made available to lawabiding members of the community and proposed the legalisation of

will be known baron kinnock of bedwellty after his former constituency lord kinnock who led labour from until was until recently one of britains eu commissioners a former critic of the house of lords he has said he will use the upper house to advocate its reform and to talk on issues like higher education i accepted the kind invitation to enter the house of lords as a working peer for practical political reasons he said when his peerage was first announced it is a good base for campaigning on national issues like education sustainable transport industrial change and the ageing society and global concerns particularly poverty and oppression during his induction into the upper house lord kinnock was accompanied by lords leader baroness amos and baroness royall of blaisdon a former aide to the exlabour leader it has been a long journey for the new lord kinnock from his earliest days as a rebellious youngster in the south wales valleys born in in tredegar to a miner father and nurse mother he attended lewis boys school in nearby pengam known then as the eton of the valleys from there he went to cardiff university where he met his future wife glenys now a labour mep after a brief career as a tutor for the workers educational association he became an mp at the age of just for his home seat of bedwellty later islwyn he gained a reputation as a leftwing firebrand voting against his own labour governments spending cuts proposals in and later rejecting a junior post in james callaghans administration but he joined the shadow cabinet in and after labours heavy defeat in the he was elected leader he took on the farleft militant tendency and began the long process of returning his party to the centre ground he was not expected to win the election when margaret thatcher was still riding high but was bitterly disappointed to lose the next one in to john major and stepped down he remained an mp until when he resigned to become european commission for transport four years later he became vicepresident of the european commission with responsibility for internal reform as he assumes the title of lord kinnock he has also become chairman of the british council which promotes the uks reputation for arts science and education terror powers expose tyranny the lord chancellor has defended government plans to introduce control orders to keep foreign and british terrorist suspects under house arrest where there isnt enough evidence to put them on trial lord falconer insists that the proposals do not equate to a police state and strike a balance between protecting the public against the threat of terrorism and upholding civil liberties but thriller writer frederick forsyth tells bbc news of his personal response to the move there is a mortal danger aimed at the heart of britain or so says home secretary charles clarke my reaction so what it is not that i am cynical or just do not care i care about this country very much but in the years that i have been alive there has not been one hour of one day of one month of one year when there has not been a threat aimed at us my point is the british have always coped without becoming a dictatorship we have coped with fear without becoming a state based on fear we have coped with threat without turning our country into a land of state threat but that is what the blair government now seeks to do create a tyranny to defend us from the alqaeda tyranny i was born on august the mortal threat back then was a scruffy little austrian called adolf hitler a week after my first birthday the threat had become reality we were at war my father wore a uniform for five years after we yearned for peace at last but in winston churchill told us from the baltic to the adriatic an iron curtain has descended across europe behind the iron curtain another genocidal psychopath another threat josef stalin triggered the cold war with the berlin blockade in my whole generation was blighted by it we were threatened by the nuclear holocaust the nuclear wind the nuclear winter we built shelters that would have sheltered nothing we spent our treasure on weapons instead of hospitals we took silly precautions some fought it some marched futilely against it some pretended it was not there the cold war lasted years but we remained a parliamentary democracy by the early seventies it was terrorism as well al fatah black september red brigades but most of all for us the ira and the inla thirty more years policemen and women over soldiers more than civilians dead but we won because even ira bombs could not force us to become a tyranny that was why the tyrants lost civil rights were infringed as little as humanly possible evidence had to be taken in secret to protect covert sources yes and one judge nojury courts had to be instituted when juries were terrorised informants had to be given immunity from their own crimes to win the bigger battle but habeas corpus did not die right of appeal was not abolished now the threat is islamic fundamentalism its leaders want to destroy our society so did the ira it is based and funded abroad so was the ira it has sleeper fanatics inside our society so did the ira it is extremely hard to penetrate with our agents so was the ira the prime movers are not easy to bring to trial neither were the ira but we did and without becoming a tyranny now the blair government proposes the law system of fascism and communism the citizen can be arrested and held without charge or trial not even on the careful consideration of an experienced judge but the whim of a political activist called a government minister to be protected from terror the government says we must become a tyranny but a tyranny is based on the citizens terror this is not victory this is defeat before a shot is fired an interesting article its good to see widening participation in the debate but i suggest we move one step further our own bombs and bullets will can only shatter peace because invading foreign nations imprisoning the innocent and hunting in the shadows cannot destroy an evil of the mind and hatred within the heart rather than focusing upon effect we should consider the cause because terrorism does not begin with bombs why not try a foreign policy of compassion it can only enhance our democracy and share our freedom i agree with frederick forsyth we really cant deal with terrorism by turning britain into a fascist state what we really need is more honesty from our security services and our politicians if they do not have evidence to bring these people to trial there probably isnt any our security services behave like the detective who having decided that a certain person is guilty rakes over all kinds of obscure and flimsy evidence to try and prove it while the real villain gets away remember there were no wmd in iraq just because a person may have made some stupid and naive decisions in life does not make them a terrorist in this overly politically correct society it is good to see someone like mr forsyth speak out yes there has been oppression by the british government in the past and overstepping the mark in places like ireland but yes we are still a democracy where it is rare to be arrested without chargetrial etc apart from a number of prisoners in belmarsh goal for examplethis country signs up to human rights and then pretends that they only apply to the people with nothing to fear the innocent people defined by whom when id cards become mandatory the data collected will not be protected by the data protection act and will be readily available to people like gchq with no control by the person whose id is being checked the threat now is new you cannot compare the threats of past years with now forsyth says died over years or terrorism people died in one morning in ny on september th the threat today is that terrorists will acquire nuclear or biological technology a kilo of semtex will flatten a building a kilo of plutonium will flatten a city you now have a combination of people who will perform terrorist acts with technology that is rapidly becoming accessible i agree the government is probably encouraging a degree of masshysteria and talking up the threat but talkingdown the threat and doing nothing is unacceptable too the problem with this issue is not that it isnt important but the fact that in general we brits can be so politically apathetic some times that we will just let this go without telling the government no however as the nation that gave the world the common law and a true sense of the rights of individual liberty i hope this will prove to be one step too far as somebody of chinese origin i can say that this country used to be a good place to migrate and start a new life whilst life wasnt perfect we could make better for ourselves now we are riddled with red tape and be told what we can or cannot do we have to be politicallycorrect and we are not allowed to have beliefs or opinions we have a prime minister who spends too much time meddling in us politics and affairs which have little to do with the lives of british citizens at home or abroad mr forsyth has done a good job in voicing his opinions lets hope the bbc doesnt get gagged for letting people express their views the people have the right to know and the bbcs role is to inform educate and entertain i agree terrorists intend to spread fear but in reality it is the government which has spread the fear by its constant publicising of the this invisible enemy so dangerous that we must allow them to ride roughshod over our rights and liberties in the end the very thing we seek to protect is what we are giving up in the name of safety from this invisible enemy the terrorists have already won i absolutely agree with frederick forsyth yes we have to defend ourselves against terrorism but existing laws seem to be more than adequate the idea that the new terrorism demands new powers is erroneous the evidence of any real terrorist capability in the uk is scant ricin for example is a dangerous poison but it is not a weapon of mass destruction what is really worrying is the enthusiasm of mr blair and his government for authoritarian reactions and attempts to manipulate the electorate through fear if the government has its way with id cards tracking and so on then totalitarianism has won and as such it then matters little whether we give in to the terrorists demands or not we will have lost the precious freedom which bush and blair constantly tells us we have and that they seek to bring to others i agree wholeheartedly with mr forsyth i am shocked at the ease with which this government is prepared to wipe out a major portion of the liberties that british people have enjoyed for centuries the right not to be deprived of our liberty without a trial in open court that goes right back to magna carta and ordinary people have spilled their blood to enforce that right against governments who thought they knew best when you look at todays britain you realise george orwell was only wrong about one thing the date frederick forsyth puts it beautifully the government is seeking to introduce a police state the new powers of home internment without trial follow a pattern which includes the introduction of surveillance via compulsory id cards and the linking of data bases together with the unbritish idea that we will have to swear allegiance to the state at the age of years we are sleepwalking into this wake up an interesting view but missing two crucial facts of this new threat if these terrorists acquire weapons of mass destruction they will use them without fear of mutually assured destruction that kept the cold war in a state of tense balance these people will use devastating force against us without fear of any consequence the terrorists are prepared to use suicide bombers which means they could kill innocent people on the london underground and we could do very little to stop it because these terrorists are potentially so deadly we have to come up with new tougher responses it will be a little late in the day when people outside london wake up one morning to find out that london has been nuked we wont have much of a society left to debate hes correct in most of what he says mind you he does seem to have forgotten that disgraceful internment policy in northern ireland which probably caused many idealistic if misguided young catholics to join the ira administrative detention of muslims could have a similar effect now surely we the public would be better protected if the security services rather than alerting a suspect terrorist by placing them under house arrest and for how longthey were to place suspect terrorist under surveillance and maybe acquire sufficient evidence to prosecute or even better prevent a terrorist attack i dont usually have much time for mr forsyths largely right wing views but this time he has got it spot on there is no doubt that there are terrorist organisations who would like to do harm to the uk but it is very doubtful whether alqaeda is a global organisation coordinating this the rise of surveillance cameras id cards the plan to charge for road use by tracking every vehicle at all times this is the stuff of nightmares add to this this new legislation which effectively means that the protection of the law will be removed from anyone at the whim of the home secretary and i genuinely wonder what sort of world my two children will inherit where will this end as it stands terrorists do not need to attack the uk its government will soon have its people terrorised more that they could very achieve with a few bombs mr forsyth has expressed exactly what my gut fears and reservations were about this proposed legislation but could not verbalise thank you mr forsyth seems to forget that killings in the troubles occurred on both sides of the religious divide and was carried out by killers from both sides he also forgets basic human rights were suspended then as now experienced judges sat over some of the greatest miscarriages of justice during those times for very little return and maximum alienation these laws and the emphasis on the islamic threat will just do the same forsyth is wrong the nature of the current threat is new it is no longer to our armed forces as the soviet threat in the eastern bloc was it is to you and i the terrorist aim to kill indiscriminately the best comparison is therefore the blitz at this time let us not forget suspects foreign and british were routinely rounded up and interned for the duration of the war without any complaints from the public we must not forget we are at war id say that that the likelihood of an attack by a sleeper cell of fundamentalist lunatics against a major uk target is a when not an if probability ill bet any money you like that the day after any such attack freddie forsyth will be saying that the government didnt do enough to protect the uk people like forsyth can only see one side of any argument and for him it is the side that is opposite new labour and tony blair i agree wholeheartedly with mr forsyth the very reason this country has been such a wonderful place to live is under attack not from terrorists but from this government the perpetuation of the perceived terrorist threat is not because of what the alleged terrorists are doing but from our own government i believe what this government is doing is at the very least highly questionable and at worst sinister at what point will they feel they have enough control over every single person in the british isles when we are all tagged and monitored constantly our freedom is being craftily and surreptitiously whittled away by this government and we are gaining nothing it should be of great concern to everyone i am slightly older than mr forsyth and therefore have lived through the same history as him i am against a police state and would not like to think that i lived in one i think that the attack on iraq made the international situation worse and may have provoked further acts of terrorism how true there are extremely worrying parallels between britain now and germany during the s i never thought it would be so easy to take over a country from within mr forsyth has forgotten one key point the terrorists who threaten britain today are well aware that hitler stalin and the ira all failed as a result modern day terrorists are willing to do things their predecessors did not that does not mean that the civil liberties of modern britain must be eroded to counter the threat that should always be the absolute last resort but to meet the new threat to defeat the sinister fanaticism of todays terrorists we may need to do things a little differently let us hope not frederic forsythes comments seem to me to be a wellthoughtout analysis of why we human society as a whole and britain in particular should resist the temptation to overprotect through fear it is this fear which enables terrorists to succeed in the end and terrorists can come in all forms as mr forsythes opening comments suggest i am reminded of a quote attributed to thomas jefferson a nation that limits freedom in the name of security will have neither the government are faced with an incredibly difficult task and have made a policy to deal with it its all very well criticising that policy but if mr forsythe cant draw on his years of experience to offer an alternative i say so what to his opinions frederick forsyths rhetoric is absurd and his conclusions laughable he distorts reality to serve his own prejudice against new labour this government seeks to balance protection of our democracy with minimum loss of civil rights it is frederick forsyth who is the extremist because he does not appreciate the need for balance i rarely find myself agreeing with my forsyth but in this instance i think he is correct the rule of law must prevail civil liberties are worth defending if the government can hold suspects without charge or trial whats next i agree absolutely by introducing fascist type laws we loose the moral high ground in our fight against terror our democratic system is not perfect but as churchill points out it is better than all the others that have been tried terrorist attacks will take place but for many reasons we should take that personal risk in return for personal freedom i do not usually agree with mr forsyth but he is spot on here the single biggest threat we face is that of a government dedicated to acting illegally and manipulating international and national law to suit its own purpose totalitarianism always requires an outside threat justifying a range of extraordinary powers leaders want the british government is a far greater threat that and terrorist organisation although in principle i agree with him frederick forsyth fails to address one key point alqaeda attacks though obviously there have been none yet in the uk seek to kill the maximum number of people the ira wanted to limit the death toll of their attacks so as to maintain support among the republican movement yes i agree with mr forsyths views i do not believe the governments plans are justified there is over reaction to and the negative influence of the us presidents interpretation of democracy and freedom he uses the same arguments that were current before the wwii the wars to liberate iraq afghanistan with syria and iran to come we are leaving a poor inheritance for the future generations mr forsyth is a wonderful writer and should keep his fiction where it belongs the british government is not going down the road that mr forsyth suggests sadly comments such as his will make a lot of people believe that they are governed by people who are fast becoming tyrants instead of being genuinely committed to stopping tyranny even if the method employed to do that is at the moment alien to the british people who have lived in a democracy protected by tony blair and others of like mind who mr forsyth seems to be putting along side the scruffy little austrian thomas hobbes would be smiling in his grave at labours propositions like new labour he called himself a libertarian like new labour he believed he was promoting the peoples best interests but as forsythe criticises this government hobbes has been criticised by most subsequent philosophers for arguing his way into the hands of the totalitarians simply put he argued that in favour of the ultimate liberty the liberty to live man should be prepared to surrender all other liberties to a supreme sovereign as protection against his fellow barbaric man hobbes has been roundly condemned by posterity and rightly so i hope new labour suffers the same treatment i agree with mr forsyths views the governments approach is totally against the spirit of british democracy they must not be allowed to get away with it of course frederick is wrong about britain winning the war against the ira and hes wrong too about the country not becoming a tyranny has he forgotten about shoot to kill torture internment without trial collusion with loyalist death squads etc my background is somewhat similar to freddies so i am persuaded to agree with many of his sentiments we can have no moral justification for imposing our system of government on anyone while we are systematically depriving our own citizens of basic individual and collective freedoms whilst the principle of keeping potential terrorists under house arrest might seem superficially attractive it is unfortunately also the first step towards totalitarianism who is to decide whom is a suspect why should we believe them who can have faith in the honesty integrity and competence of our intelligence services and politicians in light of the events of recent years what is to stop false denunciations what of those falsely accused who will lose their careers who will support their families will their children still go to school it smacks to me of the methods of nazi germany stalins russia ceausescus romania the list goes on it looks as if a new dark age is coming i see that opinion on mr forsyths remarks are divided the problem i see is that those who support imprisonment without trial believe it will never happen to them or their family only to people they dont like or are scared of but history has shown that if you have laws like that they always get abused by those in power after all today you may be scared of the same people as those in power but someday those in power may be scared of you and that day youll be the one imprisoned without the chance of justice our laws are such that you cannot just be imprisoned at the whim of our police forces you have to be shown to be deserving of it if we imprison people without trial for an indeterminate period we are no better that those we are fighting i never thought it possible for me to agree with a single word uttered by frederick forsyth but im in wholehearted agreement with him on this one we as a nation are in grave danger of being duped by pro us propaganda which of course also means well inherit most if not all of their total paranoia and allow our governments of any political persuasion incidentally to gradually and insidiously impose a police state by well tried tested back door methods i grieve for the future of my children its no wonder theyre adamant they dont ever want any of their own this government with much fanfare signs us up to the european convention on human rights but now wants to introduce indefinite house arrest without trial this puts it on a par with the government of burma like many of your respondents i wouldnt usually think of mr forsyth as someone whose views i share but in the instance of opposing charles clarks proposals for house arrest i agree wholeheartedly with mr forsyth i agree with mr forsyth just look at the facts our government along with the us invaded another sovereign country iraq by selecting intelligence that backed its case based on fear the facts turned out to be very different if individuals are treated in the same distorted way then weve done ourselves more damage than any terrorist organisation could with bombs we become animals too i agree in many ways with what mr forsyth has said if we are to be respected and have influence within the world we must be seen to be walking the walk as well as talking the talk how can we accuse countries such as zimbabwe and burma of human rights abuses when we are locking up people who may be totally innocent it is hypocrisy of the highest order mr forsyth links islamic fundamentalism to the new threat however it appears that he has misunderstood the term islamic fundamentalism it should be pointed out that a muslim who adheres to the true fundamentals of the quraan and the teachings of the last prophet muhammad is an islamic fundamentalist this person does not commit suicide in any shape or form nor does shehe kill innocent women men and children this person is selfreflective and constantly tries to better herhis actions by being good to others the people who mr forsyth labels the new threat are those who do not follow the correct teachings of islam they have arrived at their own interpretations and assumptions with regards their actions on top of that they claim to be following islam in its true form i accept that the intentions of these policies are to make britain a safer place but i cannot think of a single example from history where doing this sort of thing has ever made any difference in northern ireland internment certainly didnt achieve anything the bombings didnt stop and it could be argued that all it achieved was to just supply the ira with yet more angry and resentful republicans willing to take up arms against the british being eight years older than frederick forsyth and a survivor of the blitz on london it is easy to agree with him he is absolutely spot on during the ira bombings there were massive explosions in canary wharf to the right of where i write this and also to the left in the city of london notwithstanding these and the attempted and nearly successful assassination attempts on prime minister thatcher in brighton and on later occupants of downing street there was no retaliatory blitz on belfast or dublin as there has been on afghanistan and iraq even when england was in true peril in apart from some detentions there were no wholesale derogation of habeas corpus and the like we have to see off these latest attempts on our liberties including id cards which winston churchill decided had to go since he said the average bobby on the beat could not be relied on to not be tempted to take undue advantage against the citizen going about their lawful activities incidentally i can still remember my old id card number hence it is clear that the far too great police state powers set for the statute books have to be resisted and neutered what can i add to mr forsyths eloquently put arguments except applause well done that man for standing up and being counted in the war against tyranny super union merger plan touted two of britains big trade unions could merge to form a super union of two million members the move by amicus and the transport and general workers union tgwu would be a seen as a bid to carry more weight with ministers and employers amicus has million members and the tgwu has any merger would have to be approved by the unions executives and their membership it is understood meetings will be held on wednesday about the proposal along with the gmb and unison the tgwu and amicus worked closely together in the last year to hammer out a point deal with labours leadership over equality at work holidays and pensions the warwick agreement both unions are remaining tightlipped about the merger rumours but one insider pointed out to the bbc news website that nobody is denying suggestions a merger could be on the agenda when the two unions executives hold their meetings on wednesday amicuss executive was due to meet in any case although the tgwu is holding specially scheduled talks ukip mep attacked german empire a uk independence party mep suggested germany saw the eu as an empire and was cheaper than using tanks a new documentary has revealed mike nattrass ukips deputy leader made the comments to an audience at a meeting during last septembers hartlepool byelection campaign but challenged on the remark he denied accusing germany of using the eu as cover for a th german reich he says he was not germanbashing but saying peace was the eus founding aim the meeting was shown in a bbc film on exukip mep robert kilroysilk the former chat show host quit the party earlier this month calling it a joke the documentary showed mr nattrass apparently talking about the eu telling the meeting the germans are the big losers here but they dont care because to them the project is worthwhile its like an empire for them spreading in all directions away from germany into hungary into what they call the sudetenland czechoslovakia places like that so its cheaper for them to do it this way than roll the tanks in on tuesday he told the bbc news website he did not think the comments were offensive and worked happily with meps of different nationalities in the european parliament he argued that peace was the only reason for having the outdated eu as there was no economic justification pointing to germanys trade interests as a country in the centre of europe mr nattrass said the fact is that the eu benefits germany but it does not benefit britain im not at all germanbashing its the truth a ukip spokesman said mike has some passionate beliefs and sometimes uses excessively colourful language with which to express them the documentary showed some of the tensions between mr kilroysilk and his fellow meps after ukip took third place in last years european elections he denied wanting to be leader until october when he told bbc ones breakfast with frost programme he aspired to the job asked by the documentary makers why he had lied about his leadership ambitions mr kilroysilk said there was one thing i said that i shouldnt have said at the time i was trying to be helpful to the party and it was the wrong thing to do i should have told the truth the film also included footage of a row between mr kilroysilk mep nigel farage and party leader roger knapman about rumours that he was about to resign the ukip whip in the european parliament mr kilroysilk told them he had not left the ukip group a move he announced shortly after the meeting he told mr farage dont tell lies nigel now youve told too many most of the trouble had been caused by you ukip officials claim it was in fact mr kilroysilk not mr farage who briefed newspapers he was leaving the group of meps later in unguarded offair comments in a television studio mr kilroysilk was heard saying he was irritated by defending some of these rightwing fascist nutters mr kilroysilk separately said he had argued against ukip working with such groups which believed homosexuality was a sin a ukip spokesman said there were more than meps in the same group in the european parliament they were from a broad spectrum some rightwing some leftwing but with a shared belief in the unfeasibility of the eu as it is now he did not defend other groups religious beliefs but argued it was their right to hold such views just as mr kilroysilk had a right to criticise arab states london ukip mep gerard batten said robert has made a variety of comments about ukip and its meps there are of course two sides to every story what robert does not say is that he was offered several positions which would have given him effective control of the party but not the title of leader mr kilroysilk is to launch his own parry veritas in westminster on wednesday kilroy launches veritas party exbbc chat show host and east midlands mep robert kilroysilk said he wanted to change the face of british politics as he launched his new party mr kilroysilk who recently quit the uk independence party said our country was being stolen from us by mass immigration he told a london news conference that veritas latin for truth would avoid the old parties lies and spin ukip leader roger knapman says he is glad to see the back of mr kilroysilk mr kilroysilk promised a firm but fair policy on immigration and said they hoped to contest most seats at the forthcoming general election he said veritas would also announce detailed policies on crime tax pensions health and defence over the next few weeks labour campaign spokesman fraser kemp said veritas was joining an already crowded field on the right of british politics on thursday mr kilroysilk is due to announce which constituency he will run in at the next general election that will come amid speculation he has his sights set on defence secretary geoff hoons ashfield seat he was joined in the new venture by one of ukips two london assembly members damien hockney who is now veritas deputy leader ukips chairman petrina holdsworth has said the group will just be a parody of the party the men have left mr kilroysilk quit ukip last week after months of tension as he vied unsuccessfully for the leadership of that party he said he was ashamed to be a member of a ukip whose leadership had gone awol after the great opportunity offered by its third place at last junes european elections while ukip has turned its back on the british people i shall not he said i will be standing at the next general election i shall be leading a vigorous campaign for the causes i believe in and unlike the old parties we shall be honest open and straight mr hockney also left ukip saying mr kilroysilk would deliver better as the leader of a eurosceptic party a spokesman for ukip called on mr hockney to quit the london assembly the party asserts that mr hockney has a moral obligation if not a legal one to stand down its leader roger knapman has said he is glad to see the back of mr kilroysilk he has remarkable ability to influence people but sadly after the european election it became clear that he was more interested in the robert kilroysilk party than the uk independence party so it was nice knowing him now goodbye he said ukip officials also argue mr kilroysilk has not been straightforward in attacking the party he once wanted to lead veritas its the bnp in an expensive suit its all well and good robert kilroysilk claiming that veritas is a party that doesnt believe in lies and spin but the truth of the matter is its completely useless due to proportional representation there is no chance that veritas will have any chance in claiming power and change the twohorse race trend in my opinion this is just a publicity stunt which has just been used as a smokescreen for his antiislamism slurs which got him sacked from the television i think that his views regarding immigration are shared by many it really is time that the uk government ceased to be a paper tiger on this issue in addition as an ashfield constituent i would be more than interested in kilroy silk opposing geoff hoon good to see the parties of the right splintering in the way the parties of the left have always done lets hope kilroysilk ukip and the eurosceptic wing of the tory party all fade further into obscurity so we can have some truth in the debate about europe we benefit enormously from our membership of the eu we need to be at the heart of europe leading it and driving it to where we as a country want to go not running away from it all mouth and trousers a clown trouble is any votes he collects may just end up helping new labour into a third term whatever kilroysilk and ukip do none of their antieuropean policies have any relevance outside middle england this new party might gain support from rightwing england but will have little impact in wales or scotland hopefully this all this fighting within eurosceptic parties will allow them to slip out of the way and get people voting for real political parties which address more than one issue england needs europe to survive and as soon as people realise this the better we cant rely on the usa forever at last an impetus for increasing the likely turn out for the election the electorate is disillusioned with british politics kilroy has one agenda the uk and ill be voting for him both ukip and rks are representatives of smallmindedness and a lack of vision for the whole of humankind the interests of humanity and the world lie so much beyond the scope of these peoples bickering that who in the overall scheme of things really cares about their petty tiff many people believe you kilroy you may even believe yourself but switching horses midstream and then bad mouthing the steed that got you halfway seriously diminishes your credibility the very idea of political parties born out of such negative feelings as euroscepticism or british supremacy is nauseating one can only hope the public recognise these extremists for what they are and shun them at the polls ive always thought that kilroysilk was a selfpublicising egotist and this news does absolutely nothing to alter my opinion brilliant about time this country had a plausible party having seen the recent bbc documentary and witnessed the thoroughly disgraceful chauvinistic behaviour of a number of senior ukip figures i can well understand why kilroysilk feels embarrassed to be associated with such people hopefully the ukip members who are interested in the political debate will support his action fantastic news proeuropeans now have far less to worry about from the right the conservatives are as confused as they have been since the mids and the extreme antieuropeans are fracturing themselves into splinter groups that split any votes they might get in local european and general elections robert kilroysilks ego and vanity are his own and his supporters worst enemy as a euroenthusiast i could not be more delighted by kilroysilks behaviour he took a party that was just building up a head of steam and having exposed it to ridicule by attempting a coupdetat he is now setting about the serious business of dividing it in two the closer to straightdownthemiddle the better as far as i am concerned but in any eventuality the two sceptic parties will exhaust their energies fighting each other if every politician with ambitions to lead their party resorted to forming their own for that purpose wed have ballot papers a mile long youve got to hand it to kilroysilk for his sheer arrogance and supreme selfbelief whilst not being a great fan of kilroy i do agree with his comments about the ukip leadership and like him i am also leaving ukip i believe countless opportunities have been lost to discredit the eu and to show our people what belonging to the eu really means the eus comments last week about michael howards plans to reform immigration show how little we govern our own country when they can turn round and say immigration is a matter for the eu and not individual member states the sooner we leave this corrupt superstate the better does anyone else think that it is ironic that eurosceptic kilroysilk has used a latin name for his new party rather than a good old british name is this indicative of the man contradictory vain and pompous i think mr kilroysilk has got a very good point british politics has become too pc and as a result has no straight talking honest strong politicians they are all interested in their own careers and not the people who put them in power as a result i feel our democracy is being abused and i want it stopped if mr kilroysilk lives up to half his promises he will get my vote honestly who really cares man with tan leaves party with no plan to set up party with no idea as one of kilroysilks east midlands constituents i hope those who voted for him are proud to have been taken in by such charming vacuity i feel insulted by having him represent me in the european parliament ukip tried hard to accommodate robert kilroy silk but he made it clear that only control of it would satisfy him someone so keen on complete control was bound to fall foul of ukips democratic nature kilroy is an able communicator and a capable politician in exactly the way those who lead ukip are not he tried to make it work but they didnt seem to want to grow up he was left in the position of having to defend their gaffes to the media this new party seems a logical next step for kilroy good luck to the man i say oh please this is an amusing irrelevance there is absolutely no chance of either of these parties communicating a sensible and constructive eurosceptic argument they will play a key part in winning the country round to the idea of a reformed more democratic more dynamic europe union future generations will thank him for his ridiculousness the refreshing thing about robert is that he is open honest and straight what other politician can claim this i have a suspicion that he talks for a larger part of the electorate that his critics would like i shall be voting for him the electorate of the east midlands voted not for kilroysilk but for the ukip kilroysilk was made an mep because of his position on the ukips party list he has no mandate to represent the area and should resign from the european parliament i wouldnt write off kilroysilk while hes a clown and a one man band at the moment hes a populist and thats always dangerousthe man clearly has an enormous ego and looking at our current political masters that seems to be one of the factors in success good luck to kilroy though i think he is doing more harm than good for both his new party and ukip because their vote base is not strong enough for both parties to be successful and at the moment ukip have the upper hand while veritas are starting from square one and fighting a somewhat uphill battle the man i once found cringe worthy on day time tv could well turn out to be my countrys knight in shining armour he expresses views which are now more than common amongst society today but people are almost too scared to express them kilroy silk has secured my vote and many more like me whats more i look forward to the day when he claims victory wrecks the eu and rescues my great nation without a hair out of place and his tan as perfect as ever great stuff the longer the uk dithers over europe the richer we in ireland become as the only englishspeaking country fully committed to europe oh and send us over those hardworking immigrants our economy needs them this is just what the europhiles pray for as the main eurosceptic party ukip should try to resolve its differences with kilroy to show a united front and give the uk public a serious political voice against europe having multiple parties with the same view point just splits the vote further thank goodness that kilroysilk has gone now ukip at least has a chance in the election it is very sad to see the cause of britain regaining its proper relationship with europe damaged by this split within ukip robert kilroysilk could have a lot to offer instead we have a split party and a damaged cause under the present electoral system people must work together and small parties have no hope of representation last summer ukip achieved a major advance partly and only partly due to kilroysilk it is a great shame this has been dissipated in infighting ukip has a wide platform of policies not just withdrawal from the eu this kilroysilk conveniently ignores in the comments surrounding the launch of his own party neither the english democrats nor the new party were interested in letting him join them and take over their leadership speaks volumes veritas is the beginning of the end for kilroysilk if he believes in truth and democracy then he and the two assembly members should resign and force a byelections to stand on their own platform rather than this backdoor approach to politics of being elected for one party then defecting to another so ukip was good enough for him to lead not good enough for him to follow interesting that a party committed to plain speaking should have a latin name every opinion poll points to an overwhelming antieurope feeling in this country kilroysilk could be on the verge of something huge if he can broaden his appeal beyond this one issue he is an extremely able communicator with years of political experience we wants quality schools top hospitals clean and efficient public transport punishments that fit the crime limited asylum a purge on bureaucracy and less taxes it needs courage and honesty two qualities sadly lacking in our politicians kilroysilk may just have those very qualities recruit the right colleagues robert and your time may have come well if you cannot get enough limelight being an ordinary mp then go out and start up your own party its all flash and no real policy here lets hope this is the start of both ukip and kilroysilk slipping into obscurity veritas the name will doom it but perhaps i am wrong for surely all modern schoolchildren will understand it since they do still learn latin in the classroom do they not the whole essence of what rks represents is euroscepticism so explain to me how the tootwee label of veritas symbolises that civil servants in strike ballot the uks biggest civil service union is to ballot its members on strikes in protest at government plans to extend their pension age to the public and commercial services union will coordinate any action with up to six other public sector unions unions have already earmarked march for a oneday strike which could involve up to million uk workers the government says unions will be consulted before any changes are made to the pension system pcs leader mark serwotka warned there could be further walkouts unless there was a government rethink for a government that lectures everyone on choice choice on public service choice on this and choice on that isnt it ironic that theyre saying to public sector workers there is no choice he said if you want the pension you were promised when you started you must work for an extra five years that is working until people drop in the th century its completely unacceptable bbc correspondent stephen cape said the combined unions represented a formidable force which could embarrass the government in the runup to the general election a stoppage involving civil servants in particular could seriously disrupt or close government departments agencies and museums he said opposition to raising the retirement age is one thing all the unions are agreed on our correspondent added unisons workers the transport and general workers unions and amicus are among those being balloted about a march walkout deputy prime minister john prescott held a private meeting with senior union figures on thursday night our correspondent said that he understood no deal had been offered in that meeting but that there was room for further negotiations there was some possibility of the strike action being avoided he added tories leave door open for archer the conservative party would deal sympathetically with any application by disgraced peer lord archer to rejoin its ranks its cochairman has said dr liam fox told bbc ones breakfast with frost programme there was no place for vindictiveness in politics lord archer spent two years in prison after being convicted of perjury and perverting the course of justice the former tory deputy chairmans fiveyear suspension from the party has just elapsed a jury ruled that lord archer lied during a libel trial against the daily star at the high court in london in he won damages after the newspaper printed allegations about involvement with a prostitute dr fox was asked if he would say yes or no if lord archer applied to rejoin im sure that in line with people having served their sentence and having done some reparations for what they did wrong we would look at that sympathetically i dont believe in vindictiveness i dont think that has any place in politics unlike the prime minister and alastair campbell tory peer lord tebbit said he agreed with dr foxs view and said the case should be looked at on its merits after all he is far from being the worst perjurer in the world he added meanwhile senior conservative mp sir teddy taylor warned that moves bring lord archer back into the fold could be controversial he said i suppose on a sunday in particular we should always make provision for forgiving sinners but there is no doubt it would be controversial lord archer who was not available for comment remains a popular figure among constituency tory parties and is a successful fundraiser he has not been seen in the house of lords since his release from prison in july although there is nothing in the rules to prevent him from attending debate needed on donations cap a cap on donations to political parties should not be introduced yet the elections watchdog has said fears that big donors can buy political favours have sparked calls for a limit in a new report the electoral commission says it is worth debating a cap for the future but now is not the right time to introduce it it also says there should be more state funding for political parties and candidates should be able to spend more on election campaigning there were almost m in reported donations to political parties in and with nearly m of them from individual gifts worth more than m the rules have already been changed so the public can see who gives how much to the parties but the report says there are still public suspicions the commission says capping donations would mean taxpayers giving parties more cash something which would first have to be acceptable to the public and shown to work while we are not in principle opposed to the introduction of a donation cap we do not believe that such a major departure from the existing system now would be sensible says its report if there was to be a cap it should be a small enough amount to make a difference but which would have banned m in donations between and even without changes the commission does urge political parties to seek out more smallscale donations and suggests there should be income tax relief for gifts under it also suggests increasing state funding for parties to m so help can be extended to all parties with at least two members in the house of commons european parliament scottish parliament welsh assembly or northern ireland assembly and it suggests new ways of boosting election campaigning seen as a way of improving voter turnout all local election candidates should be entitled to a free mailshot for campaign leaflets says the watchdog and there should be a shift in the amount of money allowed to be spent at elections from a national level to a local level to help politicians engage better with voters the report suggests doubling the money which can be spent by candidates while cutting national spending limits from m to m the commission also says the spending limits for general elections should cover the four months before the poll as happens with other elections electoral commission chairman sam younger said there is no doubt that political parties have a vital role to play in maintaining the health of our democracy and for this they need to be adequately resourced our research has shown that people want to be more informed about party politics and that they want politicians to be more visible and accessible the public are reluctant for the state to fund parties but at the same time are unhappy with large private donations he called for a wider public debate on party funding to find the consensus needed for radical changes to the current system conservative backing for id cards the tories are to back controversial government plans to introduce id cards the shadow cabinet revealed its support ahead of next weeks commons vote on a bill to introduce compulsory id the decision follows a tough meeting where some senior tories argued vociferously against the move party sources told the bbc the bill which ministers claim will tackle crime terrorism and illegal immigration is expected to be opposed by the liberal democrats they have said the scheme is deeply flawed and a waste of money sources within the conservative party told the bbc michael howard has always been in favour of id cards and tried to introduce them when he was home secretary the party has been agnostic on the issue until now but had now decided to come off the fence the tory source said despite giving their backing to id cards the conservatives insisted they would hold ministers to account over the precise purpose of the scheme they said they would also press labour over whether objectives could be met and whether the home office would deliver them and they pledged to assess the cost effectiveness of id cards and whether peoples privacy would be properly protected it is important to remember that this bill will take a decade to come into full effect a spokesman said it will do nothing to solve the immediate problems of rising crime and uncontrolled immigration lib dem home affairs spokesman mark oaten said this has all the signs of michael howard overruling colleagues concerns over id cards the tories should have the courage to try and change public opinion not follow it the new chairman of the bar council guy mansfield qc warned there was a real risk that people on the margins of society would be driven into the hands of extremists what is going to happen to young asian men when there has been a bomb gone off somewhere they are going to be stopped if they havent id cards they are going to be detained howard denies split over id cards michael howard has denied his shadow cabinet was split over its decision to back controversial labour plans to introduce id cards the tory leader said his front bench team had reached a collective view after holding a good discussion but admitted it was not an easy issue he had decided to support the plans as the police said they would help fight terror crime and illegal immigration the lib dems have pledged to oppose the bill when it is debated next monday tory sources say senior party figures had argued vociferously against the id card scheme among those reported to have serious reservations over the strategy were senior shadow cabinet members david davis oliver letwin and tim yeo but mr howard denied mr yeo his transport and environment spokesman said the plans stink he also said he was confident shadow home secretary mr davis would set out the position very clearly when he stands up to debate the matter next week mr howard said the police had said id cards could help them foil a terror bomb plot in which people could lose their lives he added when the police say that you have to take them seriously he acknowledged there were good libertarian arguments against the cards but said the shadow cabinet had weighed up all the conflicting interests before reaching its decision i dont pretend that it is an easy decision but at the end of the day a decision has to be taken he also denied he was afraid of looking soft on the issue compared to labour the conservatives announced their support for the government plans on monday evening sources within the party told the bbc mr howard had always been in favour of id cards and tried to introduce them when he was home secretary but the tories insisted they would hold ministers to account over the precise purpose of the scheme they said they would also press labour over whether objectives could be met and whether the home office would be able to

is going to happen to young asian men when there has been a bomb gone off somewhere they are going to be stopped if they havent id cards they are going to be detained tory exminister douglas hogg said he opposed the plans for id cards branding them a regressive step which would intrude into the lives of ordinary citizens without any counterbalancing benefits he predicted ultimately carrying the cards would become compulsory and that would lead to large numbers of britains ethnic minorities being stopped by police galloway targets new labour mp george galloway is to stand against proiraq war labour mp oona king at the next general election mr galloway who on thursday won in libel damages from the daily telegraph said he would contest bethnal green in london for respect the glasgow kelvin mp who was expelled from labour over his anti iraq war stance accused ms king of being a new labour stooge ms king said she was delighted at the chance to take on mr galloway mr galloways current constituency is set to disappear under planned boundary changes in scotland the yearold mp launched respect the unity coalition in january along with antiwar activists and the muslim association of britain the partys declared aims are an end to the occupation of iraq the repeal of antiunion laws and the end of privatisation speaking from a cafe in brick lane east london mr galloway said he had accepted the partys invitation to stand with great honour and pride he added here in this constituency of bethnal green and bow there is a new labour stooge mp a stooge who will sing any song make any speech do any dance do anything she is told to by tony blair irrespective of how her constituents are adversely affected or how strongly they feel to the contrary ms king has represented the constituency since she said im delighted ive been given the chance to finish him mr galloway off and believe me i will i know many people around the country will be grateful not least his constituents in scotland who he has shamelessly abandoned in junes european parliament elections respect failed to gain enough votes for an mep but did come first in tower hamlets borough most of which is covered by the commons constituency of bethnal green and bow a month later it gained a council seat in a byelection in st dunstans and stepney green ward tower hamlets mr galloway said that in next years expected general election and local elections a year later the party would turn the east end of london into a fortress both the conservatives and the liberal democrats have chosen prospective parliamentary candidates for bethnal green and bow from the bangladeshi population which makes up almost half the electorate the telegraph was sued for libel by mr galloway after the newspaper claimed he received money from saddam husseins regime in iraq the newspaper said it was in the public interest to publish the claims based on documents found in baghdad mr justice eady said he was obliged to compensate mr galloway and to make an award for the purposes of restoring his reputation election deal faltered over heath role the tories failed to hold onto power in after liberals demanded sir edward heath quit in return for cooperation documents released after years reveal the failed negotiations by the then prime minister following the dramatic february general election liberal leader jeremy thorpe appeared willing to form a coalition government but it partly collapsed over the conservative leaders own role prompting the queen to ask harold wilson to form a labour government the february general election surprised the nation when it created a hung parliament with no party in overall control sir edward had gone to the country for a fresh mandate amid the spiralling economic crisis a miners strike and the subsequent threeday week labour emerged with the most seats but its mps were short of the number mr wilson needed to form a majority sir edward who had received more votes but had fewer mps believed he had the authority to remain at number providing the liberal mps would support his government he said the liberals could keep out labour in three ways lend ad hoc support to his minority government help draw up the governments programme or have up to three cabinet members in a coalition with the conservatives according to the documents released at the national archives the friendly and easy first meeting indicated that both sir edward and mr thorpe thought they had the makings of a deal mr thorpe was in high spirits having just led his party to a historic jump in support he also argued for a grand coalition of all three main parties but sir edward said that was impossible because the labour left was set against it and the pair settled on trying for a conservativeliberal pact hours later sir edwards hopes of a deal unravelled as mr thorpes colleagues refused to support him jeremy said he was encountering a rather embarrassing problem with his colleagues about the prime minister personally reads a telephone memo for mr heath they feel they could not agree to serve as long as he is the prime minister asked if this was his own view he said no it was not i am very close to ted and thought he was by far the most able man we had and he would be perfectly happy to serve it was only some of his colleagues who were being difficult the following day the stickling points had clearly become twofold mr thorpes colleagues wanted electoral reform and sir edwards resignation mr thorpe told sir edward i am sorry this is obviously hell a nightmare on stilts for you somehow i personally hope that we can work something out four hours later sir edward called the liberal leader back to downing street in a last attempt at a deal the minutes of the meeting show how the chance of a coalition government quickly evaporated the pm said he was bound to tell mr thorpe that his colleagues had told him that they would not agree to serve under any other prime minister mr thorpe was at liberty to verify this by talking to one or two of the prime ministers colleagues documents show that sir edward mulled over resigning and perhaps returning to coalition government in a labourled coalition but he already knew mr wilson would not form a coalition with either the liberals or the conservatives because of the opposition of the labour left within hours of his final talks with mr thorpe sir edward told the nation he was resigning and the queen invited mr wilson to form a new minority government ukip outspent labour on eu poll the uk independence party outspent both labour and the liberal democrats in the european elections new figures show ukip which campaigned on a slogan of say no to europe spent m on the campaign second only to the conservatives m the campaign took ukip into third place with an extra meps labours campaign cost m the lib dems m and the greens according to figures revealed by the electoral commission on wednesday much of the ukip funding came from yorkshire millionaire sir paul sykes who helped bankroll the partys billboard campaign critics have accused the party of effectively buying votes but a ukip spokesman said labour and the conservatives had spent m between them on the last general election with the advantages of public money the others have the only way the smaller parties can get their message across is by buying the advertising space he added campbell returns to election team exdowning street media chief alastair campbell will return to the fold to strengthen labours general election campaign the party has confirmed mr campbell has consistently made public his keenness to play a part in the poll expected in may both culture secretary tessa jowell and deputy prime minister john prescott have welcomed his return he is a strong labour party member mr prescott told bbc ones breakfast with frost programme mr campbell quit number in august after being tony blairs righthand man at the and elections labour have refused to discuss his exact new position and have not said how it would affect his downing street replacement david hill of course alastairs going to be part of the election campaign and i think that all of us who will also be part of the election campaign are very pleased about that ms jowell told sky news but she said his return would not put anybody elses nose out of joint this is the daft thing about the way in which politics is written about ms jowell added theres room for everybody we serve the country better if we make room for all the talent a labour source told the sunday times mr campbell would effectively front the election media campaign but said he would be given no formal title labour strategists told the paper he would be set loose on conservative leader michael howard in attacking his partys economic record when it was in power they used pictures from the s in the campaign to remind people of the winter of discontent and now its our turn the source told the paper making michael howard leader gives us an unmissable opportunity to remind people what it was like to pay mortgage rates of even if it was more than a decade ago mr campbell was at the centre of the governments row with bbc over andrew gilligans story about the iraq weapons dossier the hutton inquiry cleared him of sexing up the dossier in the runup to the iraq war since leaving downing street he has toured the country with his one man show an audience with alastair campbell and presented a number of interview programmes for channel conservative mp defects to labour a conservative mp and former minister has defected to labour robert jackson mp for wantage in oxfordshire said he was disillusioned with the partys leadership and its dangerous views on europe prime minister tony blair declared himself delighted saying mr jackson would be warmly welcomed by labour mps mr jackson who has clashed with his leaders over tuition fees and europe in the past served as higher education minister between and in a letter to his constituency chairman he wrote it is in the countrys best interest that tony blair rather than michael howard should form the next government while saying he admired mr blairs courageous leadership of the country he bitterly criticised the conservatives stance on europe the conservative partys hostility to europe has now hardened to the point at which it advocates the unilateral denunciation of britains treaty obligations he wrote mr blair said mr jackson was a decent fairminded and dedicated public servant who will be warmly welcome by labour mps and members as he rightly says the conservatives have learned nothing from their two election defeats and are if anything drifting further rightwards he added a spokesman for michael howard said mr jacksons views on policy issues were very different from those of the party leadership he believes students should pay tuition fees that tony blair should not be criticised over his handling of the iraq war and that more powers should be given to europe the spokesman said he added that it was not surprising mr jackson had chosen to leave the conservatives mr jackson is due to stand down at the next election he is the third conservative mp to defect to labour since tory stalking horse meyer dies sir anthony meyer the tory backbencher who challenged margaret thatcher for the party leadership in has died he was had been suffering from cancer for many months and died at his london home that failed stalking horse leadership challenge made it easier for michael heseltine to mount his own bid that in turn paved the way for john major to move into downing street after the second ballot meyers constituency party clwyd north west which he had represented as an mp for more than years deselected him as a result of that challenge sir anthony john charles meyer was born on october educated at eton and at new college oxford he served in the scots guards from to and was wounded in tanks in normandy he worked under edward heath on europe at the foreign office and subsequently won the eton and slough seat for the tories in by votes labour regained the seat two years later and meyer had to wait until before he could reenter parliament his prospects of a front bench slot remained remote because he tended to defy the party line mps issued with blackberry threat mps will be thrown out of the commons if they use blackberries in the chamber speaker michael martin has ruled the handheld computers can be used as a phone pager or to send emails the devices gained new prominence this week after alastair campbell used his to accidentally send an expletiveladen message to a newsnight journalist mr martin revealed some mps had been using their blackberries during debates and he also cautioned members against using hidden earpieces the use of electronic devices in the commons chamber has long been frowned on the sound of a mobile phone

figures last week it is understood no deal was offered in that meeting but there was room for further negotiations parties warned over grey vote political parties cannot afford to take older uk voters for granted in the coming election says age concern a survey for the charity suggests of overs say they always vote in a general election compared with just of to year olds charity boss gordon lishman said if a decisive blow was struck at the election it would be by older voters who could be relied on to turn out a total of adults aged or over were interviewed for the study mr lishman urged the next government to boost state pension he also called for measures to combat ageism and build effective public services to support us all in an ageing society older people want to see manifesto commitments that will make a difference to their lives mr lishman said political parties must wake up to the fact that unless they address the demands and concerns of older people they will not keep or attract their vote in the survey carried out by icm research of people aged between and said they never voted in general elections among the overs said they would be certain to vote in an immediate election compared with of people under age concern says the overs are united around key areas of policy they want the government to focus on for pensions and the nhs were key issues while the economy was important for a third and tax was a crucial area for the report was welcomed by conservative shadow pensions secretary david willetts the pensioners voice must certainly be heard in the next election as they have never fitted into blairs cool britannia he said labours continued refusal to admit the true extent of the pensions crisis will be one of the monumental failures of this government he pointed to tory plans to increase the basic state pension to reduce means testing strengthen company pensions and encourage savings a liberal democrat spokesman said the party took the issues raised in the report very seriously he highlighted the partys promises to raise the basic state pension provide free longterm care for the elderly and replace council tax seen as a particular problem for pensioners on fixed incomes labour has said it wants to use savings reforms to incapacity benefit to improve the basic state pension and has set up a review of the council tax system csa chief who quit still in job the head of the failing child support agency widely reported to have resigned three months ago is still at the helm of the troubled organisation doug smiths departure was announced by work secretary alan johnson on november as mps grilled him over the agencys poor performance his resignation was referred to by both tory and lib dem leaders during that days prime ministers questions officials now say he did not resign but will move on under civil service rules mr smiths departure was reported widely at the time as his shouldering the blame for the failings of the child support agency in january the mps who make up the commons work and pensions committee published a highly critical report into the failing agency noting the chief executive has now left and hoping the new leadership will bring a fresh approach to what is a failing organisation on that days today programme mr johnson was asked why mr smith had been allowed to resign rather than be sacked he replied the chief executive decided it was time to move on there is a new chief executive coming in it now emerges that the widespread belief mr smith made commander of the order of the bath in the new year honours had left was wrong a department for work and pensions spokeswoman confirmed mr smith was still in post and that he would continue in the job until a replacement was found no date was ever given for doug smiths departure she said adding that the post had been advertised tory work and pensions spokesman david willetts said families affected by csa failings would wonder why mr smith was still in his job three months after his departure was announced the csa has been surrounded by controversy since its introduction in to assess and enforce child support payments by absent parents the work and pensions committee launched their inquiry into the csas performance after it became clear that despite the introduction of a simpler system of calculating maintenance payments for new cases in a backlog of claims was still building up it is currently chasing outstanding payments of more than m while a further m has been designated as unrecoverable the mps found american it giant eds m system was nowhere near being fully functional and the number of dissatisfied disenchanted and angry customers continues to escalate in november when he surprised mps and the watching media by announcing mr smiths departure mr johnson said i should tell you that doug has decided that now is the time to stand aside and to allow a new chief executive to tackle the challenges ahead doug has exceeded the four years that senior civil servants are now expected to remain in a particular post so doug believes that we have reached the natural breakpoint at which he can hand over the reins lib dem sir archy kirkwood who chairs the commons work and pensions committee said that when mr johnson had announced mr smith was going he got the clear impression the csa chief was retiring though it had since emerged that was not the case and he may be seeking new employment opportunities he added his committee was duty bound to allow the work and pensions secretary to get new management into place in the csa and it would be premature to say anything further on the issue at the moment but committee member and tory mp nigel waterson said he was amazed mr smith was still in his job when mr smith and the secretary of state came to give evidence we were led to believe he was going shortly he said even if he was working out three months notice he should have been clearing his desk by now asked on thursday about mr smiths position mr johnson told bbc radio s world at one he thought it was a nonstory he added that he had been absolutely open when he announced mr smiths departure to the select committee and how people chose to interpret it was a different thing the major issue is have we got a new chief executive coming into this very important agency as quickly as possible and have we gone through the right selection process to make sure weve got the right people he added parties plans for council tax anger at council tax rises spilled over into mass protests in when the average english bill rose pensioners protests spread some marched others simply refused to pay the increase some such as yearold elizabeth winkfield said they would rather go to jail the audit commission found the whole local government finance system was fundamentally flawed and all three of the main parties have said the system has to change labour says it wants to retain the propertybased tax but reform it to make it fairer and says there is scope for councils to become more efficient they say they are already helping pensioners with council tax bills with a lump sum for the overs and last year the government capped some local councils budgets to keep demands down deputy prime minister john prescott has said the current system is not sustainable in the long term and said there would be radical reform the party says this years increases will be the lowest in a decade a report last year looked at increasing the number of council tax bands and other forms of local taxation such as reformed business rates although no decisions have been made an independent inquiry into its findings the lyons review is due to report back at the end of the tories have promised a reduction on bills for pensioners who they say have been hardest hit by yearonyear increases in council tax they say they can save bn on government waste of which bn could be used to cut pensioners bills by an average of it would not be means tested say the tories because that would create more bureaucracy and could discourage people from saving for their retirement instead households where council tax payers are over would get a rebate covering half their bill up to a maximum of the tories also say they are suspicious about any proposals to revalue homes currently graded according to their value in because they believe seven million of homes could move up a band the liberal democrats want to do away with the council tax altogether and switch to a local income tax of the kind seen in the usa norway and switzerland the rate would be set locally but administered by the inland revenue which they say would save at least m they say the council tax is the most unpopular and most unfair tax in britain because it puts a ceiling on what the richest pay the party says it would aim for a taxfree personal allowance or a allowance for the overs after that income would be taxed up to the lib dems say their plan is fairer more efficient has already been tested abroad and offers more accountability labour in constituency race row labours choice of a white candidate for one of the uks most multiracial seats proves the need for allblack short lists says a race group local councillor lyn brown was selected for west ham east london in a contest between two white and five ethnic minority women an operation black vote spokesman said they now wanted to meet labour party chairman ian mccartney for discussions mr mccartney recently announced party consultation on allblack shortlists however labour has so far unable been unable to comment on the implications of the west ham result ashok vishwanathan of operation black vote which aims to increase ethnic minorities participation in the political process and their representation said the result again showed allwomen shortlists were not effective in getting minority women selected i think allblack shortlists are the only way to cut to the chase and address the lack of minority candidates mr vishwanathan said last month the chairman of the commission for racial equality cre also called for ethnic minority shortlists in certain circumstances a cre spokesman said the organisation had nothing to add on the shortlist issue specifically but would be working with all the political parties to address the underrepresentation of ethnic minorities in parliament we will be raising it with each of the party leaders on a formal basis and helping them find the most appropriate way forward the spokesman said ethnic minorities make up of the united kingdom population but only of mps out of are from a visible minority group twelve of them represent labour and one is a liberal democrat if ethnic minorities were represented in the house of commons in proportion to their numbers in the population there would be ethnic minority mps mps tout lords replacement plan a group of mps has tried to raise the pressure on tony blair over reform to the house of lords by publishing a detailed blueprint for change the crossparty group has unveiled a draft bill proposing a smaller second chamber in which of members would be elected mps and peers have failed to agree on reform since when hereditaries lost their seats the group says it can win support for removing the last hereditaries the government postponed plans to remove the remaining hereditary peers because they said they were unlikely to succeed after opposition in the lords tony blair has argued there needs to be consensus on reforms there have been suggestions there will be proposals for changing at least the powers of the lords in labours manifesto but the allparty group including tories ken clarke and sir george young labours robin cook and tony wright and liberal democrat paul tyler is confident its plan would win support from a large majority and they list former conservative leader william hague and former labour leader neil kinnock as supporters of the plans the group says the british public and a clear majority of mps support replacing the lords with a largelyelected second chamber their plan would see the house of lords being renamed the second chamber of parliament and its members would be known as mscps there would be mscps including elected members appointed members and bishops they would serve for between and years mr cook said holding elections for mscps on the same day as those for mps might help motivate the electorate and increase voter turnout he added over the last year i have seen many statements from senior figures of this government insisting the public must have the right of choice what could be more important than a choice of the people who sit in our parliament the group believes pressure is growing for change and the governments current position is unsustainable it wants all three main parties to include a commitment to a largely democratic second chamber in their manifestos mr clarke said the issue went to the heart of reforming the health of the british political system and mr tyler said the prime ministers view that there was no agreement on the shape of the future of the lords was flawed the problem i think in the prime ministers mind is there doesnt appear to be a consensus that includes him he said we are providing a consensus the elect the lords campaign said the draft bill was an important contribution to the debate we believe this draft bill is detailed enough to form the basis of closer parliamentary scrutiny said coordinator peter facey in lieu of any other such clear proposals the government must permit that to happen hagues sixfigure earnings shown the rewards of leaving frontbench politics are shown in the latest annual register

sums from individuals lord drayson whose company powderject won multimillion pound contracts to provide smallpox vaccine to the government after the september terror attacks gave to the party just

and philanthropist sir christopher ondaatje who gave the party a sum of and refrigerator magnate william haughey obe who gave the totals for the fourth quarter were well up on the same period of as

predictions of a low turnout in the coming general election charles kennedy has said the liberal democrat leader predicted concerns over iraq and other international and domestic issue would express themselves during the campaign his comments come as an inquiry looks at how best to boost voter turnouts exforeign secretary robin cook said people were not apathetic but fed up of pager politics and not being heard he like mr kennedy pointed to the hundreds of thousands of people who demonstrated against plans for the iraq war mr cook who is giving evidence to the power inquiry into voter turnout rates told bbc radio s today programme it was not fair to blame the public who were more interested in politics than ever before they are turned off by the way we do politics in britain theres a message there for politicians he urged politicians to avoid negative campaigning and to speak more from the heart we should be not so afraid to say what we stand for he also criticised the cult of personality politics theres far too much interest in celebrities politics are in danger of becoming another branch of the celebrity industry the government has tried a number of things in an attempt to boost voter turnout which fell to in the last general election in this has included bringing in directly elected mayors to head local authorities and trialling postal voting iraq advice claim sparks new row the tories say ministers must respond in parliament to claims that the legal advice used to justify the iraq war was drawn up at number downing street has denied the claims made in a new book about the attorney general lord goldsmiths advice lord goldsmith also denied them saying he was not leaned on in any way but the conservatives and liberal democrats say they want the publication of the full legal advice given by the attorney general the government has consistently refused to publish lord goldsmiths advice on the legality of the war saying such papers have always been kept confidential but a short statement about lord goldsmiths position was presented in a written parliamentary answer on march just before a crucial commons vote on the military action it said it was plain iraq continued to be in material breach of un resolution in his new book lawless world philippe sands a qc and international law professor suggests the parliamentary answer was written in downing street according to mr sands lord goldsmith had warned tony blair in a document on march that the use of force against iraq could be illegal and that it would have been safer to seek a second un resolution sanctioning military action mr sands told newsnight the government had prepared a legal team to be able to defend its case in case legal action was taken against the uk over the war on march military chiefs reportedly asked for an unequivocal statement about the legality of the war to make sure troops could be defended in a court of law the book being serialised in the guardian newspaper says on march lord goldsmith met then home office minister lord falconer and downing street adviser baroness morgan after that downing street proceeded to set out his lord goldsmiths view in a parliamentary answer which was then published on march said mr sands tory leader michael howard reiterated calls for the publication of the full legal advice given by the attorney general warning this issue will not go away these revelations throw an intensive spotlight on to the cavalier way in which this government operates even on an issue as important as peace and war the government needs to act to restore public confidence and trust liberal democrat foreign affairs spokesman menzies campbell repeated his partys calls for lord goldsmiths first piece of legal advice to be made public the public interest which the government claims justifies nonpublication of the whole of the advice can only be served now by the fullest disclosure in a statement to newsnight lord goldsmith said in my parliamentary answer on march i explained my genuinely held independent view that military action was lawful under the existing security council resolutions it was certainly not a view that i expressed as a result of being leaned on in any way nor as i have already made clear was it written by or at number the prime ministers official spokesman also rejected the claims saying the attorney general made it clear the words and the judgement were his but exforeign secretary robin cook says all the advice should now be published he said the claims suggested parliament had only received a prcis of lord goldsmiths second opinion and that it was actually drafted in no this would be wrong even if lord goldsmith had signed the statement mr cook said because the attorney generals advice should be an independent legal opinion not subject to political negotiation of this kind ukip could sue veritas defectors the uk independence party could take legal action to unseat two london assembly members who defected to robert kilroy silks veritas party damian hockney now veritas deputy leader and peter hulmecross were elected in on the list system the party argues the pair should give up their seats as they won them as ukip representatives not as individuals mr hockney said the law was clear that those elected on a list who quit their party should keep their seats ukip chairman petrina holdsworth urged the men to step down from the gla in a letter she said the party has taken legal advice and it is clear that we could take legal proceedings against you which could result in the return of our seats andor damages against you we would however like you to be given an opportunity to reflect on what you have done to restore your own credibility with the electorate and return the seats to the party which won them fair and square at the last election mr hockney said the law worked in exactly the same way for the gla as it did for other electoral list systems the greater london act is clear that if someone resigns who was elected on a list their party whip the seat belongs to them and not the party he said mr hulmecross and himself had no intention of resigning and added that they felt that it was ukip who were not being true to the electorate he accused the party of signing up to a deal with the tories in europe rather than sticking to an independent stance but the claim was denied by ukip spokesman who said mr hockneys accusations are like his sense of political morals empty veritas was formed by mr kilroysilk earlier this month after he quit ukip following an unsuccessful bid to take over as leader prime ministers questions so who if anyone is playing politics with the security of the nation michael howard has no doubt it is the prime minister who he claims is ramming through parliament the controversial new antiterror measures without proper debate he didnt say so but the tories believe the prime minister is playing the fear card on this one so he can look tough in the run up to the general election and they believe tony blair is using the issue to suggest the tories are soft on terrorism why on earth will the prime minister not simply take up the tories offer to extend the existing powers temporarily to allow proper parliamentary debate of the laws he demanded the prime minister claims this is the clearest indication that it is the tories who are playing politics with the issue by attempting to score cheap political points in parliament is not the opposition against to the proposed laws in principle in which case delaying a decision for further debate would be pointless what this is really about believes mr blair is the tories spotting an opportunity to embarrass maybe even defeat the government and that is more important to them than national security liberal democrat leader charles kennedy avoided suggesting anyone was playing politics with the issue he preferred to state that as with other issues like id cards the governments immediate instinct was authoritarian as is his habit nowadays the prime minister was less rough with mr kennedy than he had been with mr howard he prefers a more exasperated tone suggesting he believes the lib dems have once again just missed the point apart from all that it was electioneering as usual the very first question to the prime minister from derby norths bob laxton asked him in effect if he would carry on the excellent policy of pouring more resources into schools later birminghams sion simon even went so far as to suggest the tories were such a shower that we should have the general election now the prime minister almost blushed this was not the appropriate place to announce election day he stammered but can anyone be in any doubt that that announcement is just days away an announcement coming in the week beginning april for an election on may is where the big money is in the commons and perhaps that simple fact alone means everyone is seen to be playing politics with just about everything at the moment goldsmith denies war advice claim the attorney general has denied his statement to parliament about the legality of the iraq war was drafted by downing street officials lord goldsmith said lord falconer and baroness morgan played no part in drafting the answer he added the answer represented his view that the war was legal but was not a summary of his advice to the pm the government has resisted calls to publish the full advice saying such papers are always kept confidential in a statement lord goldsmith said i was fully involved throughout the drafting process and personally finalised and of course approved the answer he said the answer had been prepared in his office with the involvement of solicitor general harriet harman two of his own officials three foreign office officials a qc christopher greenwood and the then lord chancellor lord irvine of lairg no other minister or official was involved in any way he suggested the claim that lord falconer and lady morgan had drafted the answer were the result of a mistranscription of his evidence to the butler inquiry into prewar intelligence as i have always made clear i set out in the answer my own genuinely held independent view that military action was lawful under the existing un security council resolutions he said the answer did not purport to be a summary of my confidential legal advice to government former foreign secretary robin cook said lord goldsmiths admission that his parliamentary answer was not a summary of his legal opinion suggested parliament may have been misled the attorney general may never have presented his answer as a summary but others certainly did he said what is clear from his statement today is that he does not believe that it was a full accurate summary of his formal opinion earlier tony blair dismissed questions about the attorney generals advice and said his parliamentary statement had been a fair summary of his opinion thats what he lord goldsmith said and thats what i say he has dealt with this time and time and time again mr blair told his monthly news conference in downing street he refused to answer further questions on the issue on the question of whether such papers have always been kept confidential tory mp michael mates who is a member of the commons intelligence and security committee and was part of the butler inquiry told the bbc that as a general rule is right but its not an absolute rule he said there had been other occasions when advice had been published most recently regarding prince charless marriage plans the government could not pick and choose when to use the convention he said mr mates added this may be one of those special occasions when it would be in the public interest to see the advice which the attorney general gave to the prime minister the claims about lord falconer and baroness morgans involvement were made in a book published this week by philippe sands qc a member of cherie blairs matrix chambers he also says lord goldsmith warned tony blair on march that the iraq war could be illegal without a second un resolution sanctioning military action a short statement about lord goldsmiths position presented in a written parliamentary answer on march just before a crucial commons vote on the military action did not suggest this former minister clare short who resigned from the government over the iraq war said the ministerial answer was the same statement that was earlier shown to the cabinet as it discussed military action she said the full advice should have been attached according to the ministerial code and demanded a lords inquiry into the matter the conservatives and liberal democrats say they still want the publication of the full legal advice given by the attorney general lib dem foreign affairs spokesman sir menzies campbell said lord goldsmiths statement still did not clear up the outstanding issues if his original advice of march accepted that military action might be illegal how was it that he resolved any such doubts by the time the parliamentary answer was published on march he said only the fullest disclosure will now do manchester wins labour conference the labour party will hold its autumn conference in manchester and not blackpool it has been confirmed the much trailed decision was ratified by labours ruling national executive committee in a break with the traditional choice of a seaside venue it will be the first time since that the party has chosen manchester to host the annual event blackpool will get the much smaller february spring conference instead in what will be seen as a placatory move for years the main political parties have rotated between blackpool bournemouth and brighton and the news the much larger annual conference is not to gather in blackpool will be seen as a blow in the coastal resort in the party said it would not return to blackpool but did so in the following year bournemouth hosted the event before the party signed a two year deal for brighton to host the autumn conference colin asplin blackpool hotel association said we have tried very hard to make sure they come back to blackpool obviously we have failed in that i just hope manchester can handle the crowds it amazes me that the labour party which is a working class party doesnt want to come to the main working class resort in the country the exact cost to blackpool in terms of lost revenue for hotel accommodation is not yet known but it is thought that block bookings will be taken at the major manchester hotels after the official announcement labour attacked on howard poster labour has been accused of using antisemitic images in posters which critics claim depict tory leader michael howard as fagin the poster shows mr howard hypnotising people with a pocket watch saying i can spend the same money twice the image prompted concern from the editor of the jewish chronicle but labour insists it is simply antitory labour later took the image off its website saying an alternative idea had proved more popular with party members the party will now use focus groups to test a poster showing mr howard and shadow chancellor oliver letwin with a blackboard reading the hypnotism poster has been compared to the portrayal of the dickens character fagin in the stage version of the musical oliver there was controversy over another poster choice offered to labour members it showed mr howard and mr letwin who are both jewish as flying pigs mr howard did not comment on the antisemitism claims when asked about the poster on monday instead he pointed to how tony blair had in complained about personalised abusive campaigning mr howard told greater manchester radio it is such a pity that mr blair doesnt practise what he preaches jewish chronicle editor ned temko said there had been a mixed reaction to the first poster but emails from jewish chronicle readers showed deeper concern about the hypnotism image shylock and fagin are inextricably linked to notions of centuriesold prejudice he told bbc radio s world at one whatever the idea is i think its a difficult exercise to use images like that and to argue that you can divorce them from their historical context or meaning mr temko said he blamed cockup not conspiracy saying he did not detect inherent antisemitism in any of the parties election campaigns the poster is among one of a series of ideas shown to labour members who have been asked to choose which one should be used ahead of the election labour mp louise ellman said the hypnotism image was insensitive but urged people not to rush to call things antisemitic when they only challenged tory economic policies labour campaign spokesman fraser kemp said the poster had been misunderstood the image simply portrayed mr howard as a hypnotist he argued concern has been expressed and clearly we have to take those views on board but i would emphasise that if you see the posters the common theme is that the tories are trying to con you a labour spokesman later said the timing of removing the controversial image from the partys website was not affected by the row this has been up on the website for two weeks and there has only been a fuss in the last four days so a substantial number of people voted before there was any fuss he said but a conservative spokeswoman said this poster campaign which was offensive to many people was a big misjudgement by labours campaign team milburn defends poster campaign labours election chief alan milburn has defended his partys campaign posters amid tory claims the ads were nothing short of sly antisemitism mr milburn said he appreciated peoples concerns but insisted that what they were was antitory and not in any way shape or form antisemitic he was responding to tory spokesman julian lewis who said the ads were part of a wider trend of smearing the party labour has withdrawn two controversial posters and launched four new designs a row was sparked after the party published posters appearing to depict michael howard who is jewish as fagin and as a flying pig amid claims they were antisemitic the posters were labelled a big misjudgement by the conservatives who said labours first shot in the election has badly backfired the posters were among a series of ideas shown to labour members who were asked to vote on their favourite labour has taken them off its website saying members preferred other posters the partys four new designs launched on tuesday steer clear of the fagin or flying pig images but make clear that labour is sticking to its strategy of targeting the tory leader personally with reminders of his record in office the posters were among a series of ideas shown to labour members who have been asked to choose which one should be used ahead of the election in the commons tory spokesman mr lewis suggested the posters were part of a wider trend and reminded mps that labour chairman ian mccartney last year described shadow chancellor oliver letwin as a st century fagin given the outrage that that smear caused then how could you have thought anything other than the fact that what you were doing in reviving it in your poster advertisements was nothing more and nothing less than a calculated campaign of sly antisemitism mr milburn replied that they were not antisemitic what they were was antitory and i make no apologies at all for making clear to the british public exactly what the conservative plans would mean he said i fully understand and indeed respect the views of those who have concerns about any poster designs that have appeared on the labour party website the fagin and pigs might fly posters were taken off labours website on monday after supporters voted for their favourite poster featuring mr howard and shadow chancellor oliver letwin holding a blackboard reading a labour spokesman later said their removal from the partys website was not affected by the row kilroy names election seat target exchat show host robert kilroysilk is to contest the derbyshire seat of erewash at the next general election labours elizabeth blackman won the seat in and has a majority she says she will fight on her record as a hardworking constituency mp mr kilroysilk announced his plans a day after launching his new party veritas the latin for truth the east midlands mep who quit the uk independence party wants his new group to change the face of uk politics his choice of election constituency quashes speculation that he would stand against defence secretary geoff hoon in ashfield nottinghamshire ukip won of the vote in erewash in last junes european elections with mr kilroysilk among their candidates for the region until erewash had been held by the tories since ms blackman said she was proud of the governments achievements in the area she declined to give her view of mr kilroysilk at this point on thursday he told a london news conference that veritas would avoid the old parties lies and spin he said our country was being stolen from us by mass immigration and promised a firm but fair policy on immigration veritas says it hopes to contest most seats at the forthcoming general election but plans to announce detailed policies on crime tax pensions health and defence over the next few weeks ukip leader roger knapman says he is glad to see the back of mr kilroysilk labour campaign spokesman fraser kemp said veritas was joining an already crowded field on the right of british politics mr kilroysilk was joined in the new venture by one of ukips two london assembly members damien hockney who is now veritas deputy leader ukips chairman petrina holdsworth has said the group will just be a parody of the party the men have left mr kilroysilk quit ukip last week after months of tension as he vied unsuccessfully for the leadership of that party he said he was ashamed to be a member of a ukip whose leadership had gone awol after the great opportunity offered by its third place at last junes european elections ukips leader roger knapman has said he is glad to see the back of mr kilroysilk he has remarkable ability to influence people but sadly after the european election it became clear that he was more interested in the robert kilroysilk party than the uk independence party so it was nice knowing him now goodbye he said ukip officials also argue mr kilroysilk has not been straightforward in attacking the party he once wanted to lead immigration to be election issue immigration and asylum have normally been issues politicians from the big parties have tiptoed around at election time but no longer both labour and the tories have signalled their intention of making them central to their election campaigns they have been struck by the level of concern amongst voters about the issues with internal surveys showing they have the potential to swing large numbers of votes that was also true at the last general election and the issue did briefly become a campaigning issue but it sparked the probably predictable furore with claims politicians were either stoking up xenophobia or alternatively running scared of addressing the problem but this time around it looks set to be one of the core battlegrounds with both the big parties competing to set out tough policies the tories are already committed to imposing annual limits on immigration with a quota for asylum seekers and with applications processed outside the uk labour has already branded the proposal unworkable but party strategists have seen the tories seizing a poll advantage over the issue now home secretary charles clarke has come up with alternative proposals for a points system to ensure only immigrants who can benefit the economy will be granted entry and to kick out more failed asylum seekers that has been attacked by the tories as too little too late and for failing to tackle the key issue of the numbers entering the uk the liberal democrats have not been drawn too deeply into the argument but have called for a europewide policy on immigration but while all the parties appear to agree the time has come to properly debate and address the issue there are already signs they will run into precisely the same problems as before former union leader sir bill morris has already accused both the big parties of engaging in a bidding war about who can be nastiest to asylum seekers my concern is that whilst the labour party and the conservative party will take a constructive approach to the debate rightwing political parties picking up on statements like burden to britain will exploit this and create a lot of fear and uncertainty it is precisely that concern and the possible suggestion the issue is playing to the far rights racist agenda that will provoke strong reactions from many concerned with this issue the challenge for the big parties is to ensure they can engage in the debate during the cut and thrust of a general election while also avoiding that trap kennedy begins preelection tour liberal democrat leader charles kennedy has begun a weeklong tour to persuade voters they are the real opposition mr kennedy is visiting constituencies in somerset and hampshire on monday rural seats where his party is hoping to make gains from the conservatives later he will visit places such as liverpool where labour is targeted labour say a lib dem vote could let the tories in while the tories say the lib dems would mean higher taxes soft crime laws more power to europe mr kennedys tour comes as he labour leader tony blair and conservative leader michael howard all step up campaigning ahead of the next general election widely expected to be held on may on tuesday mr kennedy will visit leicester south where lib dem mp parmjit singh gill overturned a big labour majority to win the seat in last years byelection stops in shrewsbury north dorset liverpool manchester basingstoke and west london are planned for later in the week the liberal democrats say in the northern cities the race is between them and labour while in southern seats particularly the south west it is between them and the tories speaking to the bbcs westminster hour on sunday mr kennedy said the upcoming general election widely tipped for may would be much more unpredictable than any others in recent experience asked whether it was realistic to assume the liberal democrats could win the general election he said theres no limit to the ambitions we have as a party but we have got to be responsible we have got to be credible we have got to demonstrate to people that we are up to that task mr kennedy said the british public felt let down by labour on issues from iraq to topup fees and the conservatives were not asking the critical questions and he said people were highly sceptical about labour and conservative promises on tax but he brushed off labour suggestions a vote for his party would mean letting the tories in by the back door if you look at the four previous parliamentary byelections the liberal democrats have demonstrated that not only can we leapfrog the conservatives where we start in a third place position but we can go on to defeat the government thats going to be the story i think of this coming general election labours core support takes stock tony blair has told labour supporters hes back and still hungry for the job of prime minister but does that sum up the mood at the partys spring conference in gateshead the electorate are keener on the government than some labour party members is the dry assessment of graham lane leader of the labour group on newham council the problem according to mr lane is not continuing divisions over iraq foundation hospitals or tuition fees or even voter apathy but mr blair himself i have a new slogan vote blair get brown thats what i am telling people on the doorstep dont worry he will be gone soon his friend saxon spence leader of devon county labour group lays the blame for any lack of campaigning zeal on one issue above all others you cannot underestimate the impact of the war in iraq we lost people from our local party who had some key roles but the two friends were fired up by gordon browns speech on saturday with its appeal to core labour values on social justice health and education there was real passion i think we have all felt a little jaded but it reminded us why we joined the party in the first place said mrs spence if he hadnt have walked off the stage they would still be clapping added mr lane but for every brownite at the spring conference there was an equally ardent fan of mr blair stephen douglas from wales said after the pms speech on sunday i think it was a bit of a turning point given the roasting he has had on some issues the guy still has it tony martin of burnley said he is the first leader who has won us two terms this bloke has delivered for us malcolm shipley of shipley said it was as if he is coming round to the right approach again katrina bull a prospective parliamentary candidate said mr blair had shown he could rouse the partys grassroots i think if every voter was able to spend time in a room with tony the way we have today we will have no problem with turnout she had just emerged from a qa session in which mr blair tieless and supremely at ease answered questions posed via the partys website a party of councillors from nottingham agreed that there was nothing wrong with mr blairs leadership and they were adamant that the campaigning strength of the party in their city was as strong as ever iraq they insisted would not be a factor for most voters the biggest problem we have got at the moment is that we keep getting all these polls saying we are going to run away with the election it might sound great but it does create this sense of complacency among our own voters and i think that is the greater problem than iraq said nottingham city councillor brian parbutt and even mr blairs most vocal critics seemed to agree on one thing he is a master of the sort of glossy highprofile campaigning that has become labours hallmark epitomised by fridays whistlestop tour of marginal seats a group of shop stewards from the swan hunter shipyard who said they were facing redundancy could barely suppress their anger at mr blairs failure to as they saw it shake off his tory leanings and stand up for manufacturing in the north east they were also scathing about the alleged benefits of showpiece projects such as conference venue sage centre heralded by john prescott and others this weekend as a symbol of labours success in urban regeneration it is no good having the sage or baltic if you havent got the money for the entrance fee said terry telford but when asked about mr blairs bravura performance on friday the men agreed he was brilliant and they would all be out on the doorstep pushing the labour message come election time if you are not fired up about the election then whats the point there is no complacency as far as i can see in the labour party we are fired up we are up for this election said richie porterhouse mr telford agreed but added it was becoming increasingly difficult to think of an answer when people asked what has labour done for the north east i have had doors slammed in my face he said every activist i spoke to said they were proud of what they believed labour had achieved in their local communities the new hospitals and schools the better life chances for young people the problem they faced they said was converting this local feelgood factor into votes but they could at least rely on one secret weapon as one activist put it tory leader michael howard campaign cold calls questioned labour and the conservatives are still telephoning the millions of people who have signed up to make sure they do not get marketing cold calls the parties say they can stick to the rules by ensuring that their calls are not marketing for instance by asking about peoples voting intentions the lib dems are asking the watchdog overseeing the rules to stop the calls the information commissioners office says surveys are allowed but people had to be told if personal data was kept telephone call centres are expected to be used as never before by all the three major parties in the runup to the general election but seven million telephone numbers are on the telephone preference service tps lists which ban unsolicited sales and marketing calls both schemes are run by the direct marketing association and backed by eu directives on privacy and electronic communications the rules on marketing calls apply as much to politicians as to private sector companies but that does not mean labour and the tories are not calling people signed up to the tps a labour party spokesman told the bbc news website the party avoided those on tps lists when telephoning people about membership or fundraising but that did not happen for voter identification calls when we ask which party they will vote for that is not marketing and we have very clear legal advice that it is not he said so it is not covered by the telephone preference service he said the party always asked people if they would be happy to be contacted again and if they said no they were not rung again a conservative spokeswoman said the party stuck to the rules when it rang tps subscribers she said we do apply tps but in line with the law we would not do things that are not allowed in the law assistant information commissioner phil jones said it was classed as marketing if political parties telephoned people to encourage them to vote for them but classic market research such as a poll of voter intentions did not constitute direct marketing he said if a party is calling someone who is registered on tps and records their voting intention with a view to using this information in the future this should be clear to the voter concerned said mr jones if a party rings a person who is registered on tps to ask about their voting intention and goes on to encourage that voter to support them the party may well be in breach of the regulations in summary whether a party calling tps registered voters to check their voting intentions will breach regulations will depend on the script used and whether the script is followed mr jones said the watchdog received very few complaints on the issue earlier lib dem chairman matthew taylor wrote to the watchdog saying the advice we have received on several previous occasions is that such phone calls are illegal he says evidence from local lib dem parties around the country suggests there are significant numbers of such calls i hope you can therefore take swift and efficient action to ensure that this ceases he tells the commissioner mr taylor argues there should be new guidelines so all parties can act in the same way if the watchdog believes the rules allow parties to ring tps numbers about voting intentions and later urge those people to vote for them lib dems highlight problem debt people vulnerable to problem debts should be afforded greater protection from banks aggressively promoting financial products the lib dems say vincent cable says one in eight households already struggle with debt and that will worsen if there is a hike in interest rates or unemployment the lib dems treasury spokesman is unveiling a policy aimed at the issue he wants to see proper health checks when loans are marketed so people know to take out payment protection were economic conditions to deteriorate at all large numbers of people could be affected because they have borrowed to the limit mr cable told bbc news banks are very aggressively promoting debt in many cases there is a bigger problem ahead mr cable said the governments consumer credit bill would target some of the extreme problems such as loan sharking but ministers had been a bit complacent about the wider issue of debt levels he said much of the payment protection currently available was extremely expensive and there were lots of exclusions mr cable added that the office of fair trading should investigate the market lib dem leader charles kennedy meanwhile is in the middle of a tour of the uk aimed at persuading voters his is the real opposition mr kennedy is visiting a mixture of rural seats where his party is hoping to make gains from the conservatives and urban areas traditionally associated with labour labour say a lib dem vote could let the tories in while the tories say the lib dems would mean higher taxes soft crime laws more power to europe mr kennedys tour comes as he labour leader tony blair and conservative leader michael howard all step up campaigning ahead of the next general election widely expected to be held on may the liberal democrats say in the northern cities the race is between them and labour while in southern seats particularly the south west it is between them and the tories speaking to the bbcs westminster hour on sunday mr kennedy said the upcoming general election widely tipped for may would be much more unpredictable than any others in recent experience and he brushed off labour suggestions a vote for his party would mean letting the tories in by the back door if you look at the four previous parliamentary byelections the liberal democrats have demonstrated that not only can we leapfrog the conservatives where we start in a third place position but we can go on to defeat the government thats going to be the story i think of this coming general election lib dems target firsttime buyers the liberal democrats have unveiled plans to build new affordable homes on publicly owned land the partys scheme would allow people to buy a share in a home through a mutual home ownership trust as a way of getting onto the housing ladder the lib dems would also encourage the conversion of existing buildings in an effort to protect greenfield sites labour has already announced plans to help firsttime buyers and the tories would extend righttobuy schemes all the major parties are focusing on the issue in the runup to the election after a survey suggested firsttime buyers could not afford a home in of uk towns the lib dems say their mutual homes would let people buy a share of a property usually worth about of the building costs party leader charles kennedy said the homes would be affordable because they would be built on surplus public sector land donated by central or local government people would also only have to pay for the cost of the building and not the land he added they would spend about of their monthly salary on rent and buying extra shares in the property when they moved house they would be able to cash in on any rise in property prices by selling their share it would also allow councils to vary discounts to tenants given the right to buy their council homes so local needs were taken into account mr kennedy said mutual homes will offer people the opportunity to build up an equity stake in a home gradually investing only as much as they can afford there are also plans to prevent high house prices forcing people out of their local communities the kind of golden share used by the lib dems in south shropshire could be rolled out more widely under the plan councils secure deals with developers where they keep a share in a property scheme so properties cannot be sold on the open market instead they are sold at build cost to people who the local council decides have local needs the party says its help for firsttime buyers can be funded at no extra cost to the taxpayer but the plans involve changing the vat system which the party says often makes it too expensive to renovate existing buildings the conservatives claimed the plans would amount to an extra tax of up to on every new house this is typical of lib dem hypocrisy said tory shadow local government secretary caroline spelman they claim that they want to help people on to the property ladder but the small print of their policies reveal how they intend to price even more people out of the housing market the flagship tory proposal on housing policy is to give a million more housing association tenants the right to buy their homes labour has said it will allow council and housing association tenants to buy a share in their homes housing minister keith hill said much of the lib dem plans mimicked the governments strategy however as usual the lib dems proposals are completely uncosted he said mr hill said he also asked whether the lib dems would match labours promise to spend bn on making refurbishing and repair council homes by lib dems unveil womens manifesto the liberal democrats are attempting to woo female voters with the launch of their manifesto for women charles kennedy is pledging a maternity income guarantee and a pension system based on years of residence rather than national insurance payments he also thinks women will back plans to end university tuition fees and for free longterm care for the elderly both labour and the conservatives have said they also plan to boost pensions and to improve childcare support mr kennedy says he wants to deal with policy areas that disadvantage women two million pensioners in britain currently live below the governments own poverty line twothirds of whom are women he said he says that pensions based on the number of years worked ignore the contribution women make caring for children the lib dems citizens pension based on length of residency not on national insurance contributions would address that imbalance mr kennedy argues under the package new mothers would be offered minimum guaranteed maternity pay of a week for the first six months after the birth of their first child mr kennedy also believes the partys plans to use the money saved from not introducing illiberal id cards to boost police numbers by would appeal to women too the policies are not new announcements but the way they are structured as a package to appeal to women is mr kennedy also points to the fact that of the partys candidates set to stand in winnable or target seats are women party strategists claim that where women candidates replace men turnout rises by mr kennedy began the pitch for female support with an interview on bbc radio s womens hour on monday during the interview mr kennedy revealed that he planned to structure the partys general election campaign around the birth of his first child which is expected in april the baby and his wife sarah would be priority number one even if it arrived in the middle of the election campaign he said party strategists believe winning over a significant proportion of women voters is key to electoral success a party spokesman said it was courting female votes because they tended to vote more than men and are believed to be more considered and openminded in deciding who they vote for labours deputy minister for women jacqui smith accused the lib dems of offering false promises to women and said their sums did not add up she said these proposals would increase the costs to the public purse drastically year on year and hard working families will pay dearly through either increased taxes or reduced spending on public services the labour party has committed itself to universal affordable and flexible childcare for parents of all to yearolds including childcare centred on schools to be available from am to pm in september trade and industry secretary patricia hewitt said she would like to see longer paid maternity leave higher paternity pay and the extension of flexible working rights to carers if labour won a third term the conservatives are yet to unveil their manifesto plans for childcare but said in november they would increase maternity pay and pay the child tax credit in cash to parents to spend as they like on a nanny au pair or even a family member such as a grandparent acting as a carer they were also consulting on making childcare costs tax deductible labours cunningham to stand down veteran labour mp and former cabinet minister jack cunningham has said he will stand down at the next election one of the few blairera ministers to serve under jim callaghan he was given the agriculture portfolio when labour regained power in mr cunningham went on to become tony blairs cabinet enforcer he has represented the constituency now known as copeland since mr blair said he was a huge figure in labour and a valued personal friend during labours long period in opposition mr cunningham held a number of shadow roles including foreign affairs the environment and as trade spokesman as agriculture minister he caused controversy when he decided to ban beef on the bone in the wake of fears over bse he quit the government in and in recent years has served as the chairman of the allparty committee on lords reform and has been a loyal supporter of the government from the backbenches will tory tax cuts lift spirits michael howard has finally revealed the full scale of his planned tory tax cuts should he win the next general election he has earmarked billion that will be used to reduce taxes although he still will not say which or how this was the preelection message many in his party have been pressing for and voters he believes will warm to at its simplest it is saying vote tory and you can have it both ways not only would his government stick to labour spending plans on core public services including health and education it would increase spending on defence police and pensions and even after that was done it would still have enough left over for a tax cut equivalent to about a penny off the basic rate of income tax all the money would come from its billion efficiency savings which would see the axe taken to bureaucracy waste and the civil service of that billion would go on spending plans with billion to fill the black hole left they claim by gordon brown and the rest going in tax cuts neither mr howard nor mr letwin would say exactly how they would use that cash although a cut in the basic rate seems unlikely ideas already floated include raising tax thresholds and abolishing or reducing inheritance tax although some in the tory party are urging mr howard to announce something more eyecatching before the election as the tory leader declared the aim of the exercise is to open up a real economic policy divide between labour and the tories at this election people will have a clear choice between mr blair who will waste more and tax more and the conservative party which will give value for money and tax less he said it is a move back towards an almost traditional tory message which previously suggested labour was the party of tax rises and the conservatives the party of tax cuts the extension of that however was that labour was also seen as the party of big spending on the public services while the tories were the cutters and that is where one of the problems lies for mr howard can he persuade sceptical voters that they really can have it both ways with bigger spending on public services and lower taxes he insists he will not promise anything before the election that he cannot deliver if put into downing street labour needless to say claim his planned bn efficiency savings simply dont add up and that those sorts of figures are fantasy one of new labours greatest successes before the historic election was to persuade voters business and the city that it could be trusted to run the economy so far that has not faced any real challenge but independent analysts now claim a third new labour government would be forced to either increase taxation or taxes to plug a black hole it has at the centre of its finances meanwhile the liberal democrats are committed to increasing taxes for the most well off to finance their spending proposals launched earlier in the day so mr howard hopes his message will start to hit home during this unofficial election campaign and that his poll ratings might finally lift off the floor and while other issues like the iraq war and trust will play a major part in that campaign it is likely and the prime minister probably hopes that the economy will be the deciding factor teenagers to be allowed to be mps teenagers will be able to become mps under plans unveiled by ministers in a written statement constitutional affairs minister christopher leslie said the current minimum age of for an mp would be reduced to the proposals follow a recommendation last year by elections watchdog the electoral commission the government intends to legislate when parliamentary time allows to lower the age said mr leslie who was elected in at the age of even if the move does go ahead it is unlikely it will be in place before the next general election widely predicted for may the announcement from mr leslie who was elected in in a formerly safe tory seat prompted calls for a lowering of the voting age to the votes at alliance said it was a good thing to engage people by lowering the candidacy age but argued lowering the voting age would be much more effective candidacy affects only politicians the voting age affects millions of younger people said spokesman alex folkes we would hope that the government will table a bill that is broad enough to allow for amendments to be brought to test support for a reduction in the voting age currently candidates in both local and national votes must be while the voting age is that is because the age of majority was reduced to in but laws dating from which determine the current voting age stayed in place irish republican bernadette devlin was one of just a handful of yearolds elected to parliament in the th century winning a seat in but the youngest is understood to have been tory edward turnour who won the horsham byelection aged and days and served in parliament for continuous years last aprils report by the electoral commission said there was no strong argument for leaving the age for standing for election at the commission found the most common approach around the world is for the voting age to be the same as the candidacy age chancellor rallies labour voters gordon brown has issued a rallying cry to supporters warning the stakes are too high to stay at home or protest vote in the next general election the chancellor said the poll expected to fall on may would give a clear and fundamental choice between labour investment and tory cuts he told his partys spring conference the tories must not be allowed to win the conservatives and lib dems insisted that voters faced higher taxes and meanstesting under labour to a packed audience at gatesheads sage centre mr brown accused shadow chancellor oliver letwin of plotting cuts that were the equivalent of sacking every teacher gp and nurse in the country laying into the conservatives record in government he said i give you this promise with labour britain will never return to the mistakes of erm and inflation interest rates bn in lost reserves repossessed one million in negative equity and three million unemployed never again tory boom and bust this will be the central dividing line at the election between a conservative party taking britain back and planning deep cuts of bn in our services and a labour government taking britain forward which on a platform of stability will reform and renew our hospitals schools and public services and i am proud to say spend by bn more turning to the economy the chancellor promised to continue economic stability and growth in a third term in power he also pledged to continue the fight against child and pensioner poverty and he promised help to get young people on the property ladder my message to the thousands of young couples waiting to obtain their first home is that housing is rightly now at the centre of our coming manifesto he said and the next labour government will match our low mortgage rates with a new firsttime buyers initiative in the speech which prompted a standing ovation he also promised to end teenage unemployment within the next five years he also highlighted plans for debt relief for the worlds poorest countries a national minimum wage for and yearolds the creation of a network of childrens centres and flexibility in maternity leave responding to the speech shadow chief secretary to the treasury george osborne said this was more talk from gordon brown weve heard it all before instead of talking about the future he kept on talking about the past he completely failed to say which taxes he would put up to fill the black hole in his spending plans there will be a simple choice at the election value for money and lower taxes with the conservatives or more waste and higher taxes under tony blair and gordon brown liberal democrat shadow chancellor vince cable warned the picture was not as rosy as mr brown would like to portray it for all his trumpeting of labours management of the economy gordon browns record is very mixed he said gordon brown has created a system of massive centralisation and bureaucracy a system which subjects millions of people to means testing and a system of taxation which is extremely complex for all his positive words gordon brown is faced with economic problems looming on the horizon not least the unprecedented levels of personal debt facing the nation also in gateshead the prime minister took questions sent in by email text message and telephone as part of labours attempt to engage the public in their campaign mr blair told the audience he believed the iraq war would have made britain a safer place if its emerging democracy succeeded and that he wanted to bring troops home as soon as possible but not before the job was done he also said he wanted to carry on as pm because i still think that there are big changes our country needs brown proud of economy record gordon brown has delivered a rousing speech to labours spring conference setting out the governments agenda for the next general election the chancellor said he was proud of his partys record on the economy and would strive for continuing stability if elected the gateshead conference was told he would help young people who were struggling to buy their own homes and the chancellor vowed to continue the fight against child poverty later prime minister tony blair will answer questions sent by the public via text and email analysing mr browns position before the speech bbc correspondent james hardy said mr brown would draw sharp dividing lines with the conservatives for the forthcoming election campaign he would contrast labours plan to invest bn in services with a tory plan to cut spending by bn mr brown will lay out his credentials as a reforming chancellor determined to take on and beat the asian tiger economies which increasingly dominate world trade our correspondent said on friday night mr brown confirmed he would not make any tax commitments until the labour manifesto had been published after the budget expected in march but commentators will listen to his speech closely for hints on whether as the conservatives claim he plans to raise tax after the election the tories accuse labour of raising taxes times since coming to power in following the chancellors keynote speech the prime minister will face interactive questioning from ordinary voters on saturday mr blair is thought to be deliberately putting himself on the line in a bid to engage the electorate ahead of an expected may election capital radio dj margherita taylor will select questions to put to him from thousands emailed and sent by text the prime ministers enthusiasm for the job remains undimmed alan milburn labours election strategist told radio s today programme on saturday mr blair has the same passion and the same commitments for the job as when labour came to power in he said and he confirmed mr blairs insistence that no poll date had yet been set he said im the general election coordinator and i dont know and tony has not made up his mind on friday the prime minister completed a whistlestop tour of england during which he unveiled his partys six preelection pledges starting in london he visited marginal constituencies pledging to build on what he said were labours achievements on the economy crime education and public services the conservatives and lib dems said the pledges set to underpin labours election campaign were worthless blair joins school sailing trip the prime minister has donned a life jacket and joined school children in a sailing dinghy as he sought to sell his partys education policies tony blair sailed across the lake in bromsgrove worcestershire while on a visit with education secretary ruth kelly to back school outings mr blair later stressed labours election pledge to focus on education when he met parents in the area the conservatives and lib dems both say his pledges are worthless all the parties are stepping up campaigning ahead of a general election widely expected to be held on may mr blair looking a little windswept joined two girls from st egwins middle school in evesham and an instructor for a trip in the wayfarer dinghy closely followed by a boat full of photographers afterwards he said outdoor activities were beneficial for children but accepted that lots of teachers now worried about taking part for fear of being sued if something went wrong what were doing is introducing some simple guidelines so if teachers follow those they are not going to be at risk of legal action mr blair said when you are doing these types of activities youve got to exercise some common sense there obviously you cant have a situation where parents or teachers end up being worried that theyre going to be subject to all sorts of legal action if they take children sailing or doing outdoor activity that is actually good for the kids and good for their health and their character the pledge on education your child achieving more was one of six election pledges unveiled by mr blair last week if it wins a third term in the general election expected this year labour is committed to giving parents more choice between schools allowing all secondary schools to take on specialist status opening city academies and creating more sixthform places it aims to improve discipline in schools by adopting a zero tolerance approach to disruption of classes and introducing fixed penalty notices for truants labour also plans to give head teachers at groups of local schools control over funding for units to handle disruptive pupils parents and teachers who met mr blair on tuesday were invited to the informal discussion after writing to their mps to raise concerns about education it is the latest in a series of events designed to show the prime minister is speaking directly to voters in the runup to the election and that he has not lost touch for the conservatives shadow education secretary tim collins said mr blairs government is all talk he must be judged on what he has done in two terms not what he mendaciously claims he would do in a third that judgment will be damning the liberal democrats are promising to cut class sizes for the youngest children and ensure all children are taught by a qualified teacher in each subject analysis no pain no gain he called it his masochism strategy in the runup to the iraq war and now tony blair has signed up for another dose of pain the idea is simple the prime minister goes head to head with an often hostile group of real voters in the full spotlight of the television cameras the theory is that talking to the great british public even if they are the great unwashed is better than having the media filter what voters hear from politicians it is also the most effective way of showing that he is aware of real peoples concerns and on occasions of their outright fury mr blair used the tactic before the iraq war to try to show he really was engaging with public concerns and you can expect to see it much more in the runup to the election labour knows it has been damaged by accusations of spin control freakery and overslick presentation sometimes from within the ranks of its own mps tony blair himself has said people complain he does not listen mr blairs latest bout of flagellation came with a series of questions sessions on five television throughout wednesday the trouble began on the wright stuff show with maria hutchings marching up to him saying tony thats rubbish as she tried to complain about her autistic sons school being threatened with closure a few dont worries as mrs hutchings was led back to the audience averted a public slanging match he spoke to her privately after the show but that was only the start and later sessions produced the type of grilling not even the toughest television interviewer could produce writer neil coppendale from west sussex asked of the iraq war tens of thousands of innocent men women and children died how do you manage to sleep at night on immigration london teacher diane granger said where are you going to put everyone and can you imagine even jeremy paxman putting the question posed by brighton nurse marion brown would you wipe somebodys backside for mr blair tried to use the questioners first names and sometimes threw them off their stride by asking what they would do about the problems many of the newspapers have branded the exercise a pr stunt which backfired indeed there is a danger mr blair simply ends up looking embattled conservative michael howard and liberal democrat charles kennedy are to be offered chances to appear in similar slots on the channel next month labour strategists believe more of the sessions will mean the hecklers no longer become a story and the real issues take prominence james humphreys exhead of corporate communications at number says the strategy shows frustration with the media they feel they dont get their voice across and going direct to people is clearly their game on this occasion he says there are risks but the prize is tackling the trend of lower turnouts at the polls he argues the prime minister knows full well the potential hazards he must remember with gritted teeth his confrontation with sharron storer the birmingham woman who harangued him over the state of her local hospital in the election campaign all you do is walk around and make yourself known you dont do anything to help anybody she told mr blair before stomping off refusing his pleas to discuss the issue privately former downing street media chief alastair campbell has described the episode as a bit of a disaster as it meant the launch of labours election manifesto received little coverage but it was seen as one of the few moments when that election campaign came alive not least because it coincided with john prescotts even more direct contact when he punched an eggthrowing protester former prime ministers too have come to grief at the hands of a persistent member of the public the undoubted highlight of years of election phonein shows was margaret thatcher discomfort on nationwide in when viewer diana gould put her on the spot about the sinking of the belgrano in the falklands war john major reaped the benefits of street campaigning during the election campaign with his famous soapbox it may have left him splattered with eggs and engine oil at times but he felt it added fizz to his campaign in his memoirs he also argues the strategy contrasted with neil kinnocks contrived photo opportunities and attempts at an artful campaign he wanted to look like a prime minister i was prime minister and i wanted a flesh and blood fight says mr major mr blair told prospective labour mps on thursday that taking part in phoneins and public meetings could enthuse and engage and give the public a sense of empowerment but he also wants to counter complaints that he has spent too much time on international affairs and foreign trips mr blair recalls how bill clinton once advised him always remember that what people see of you in the news in the evening is how they think you spend your day his hope must be that voters watching him on the rack will bear out for labour the old maxim no pain no gain lib dems stress budget trust gap public trust in the handling of the economy can only be restored if gordon brown opens up his books for unbiased inspection say the lib dems city experts say there is a bn black hole in the public finances a claim denied by the chancellor lib dem spokesman vince cable said the public did not know who to believe and the national audit office should judge responding to the prebudget report mr cable also attacked labours unfair and overcomplicated taxes in his report mr brown insisted he was on course to meet his golden rule of borrowing only to invest rather than for daytoday spending over the course of the economic cycle mr cable said people did not know whether to believe the chancellor or the consensus among experts which said the rule would be broken there is an issue of credibility and trust he said we cannot have a continuation of a situation where the chancellor sets his own tests and then marks them what we need is the equivalent of a thorough ofsted inspection of the governments accounts he asked what the government had to hide mr cable also accused the chancellor of ducking tough choices he argued there are serious challenges ahead from the falling dollar and from the rapid downturn in the uk housing market and rising personal debt but they have not been confronted mr brown confirmed he was setting aside another m for the conflicts in iraq and afghanistan mr cable compared that new cost with the m needed for britains role in the entire first gulf war when of the bill had been met through help from european and arab nations he suggested keeping british troops in iraq could cost another bn with the government also planning to spend at least bn for identity cards the current economic climate meant britain could not afford the reckless george bushstyle tax cutting spree planned by the tories he said instead what was needed was simple and fair taxation rather than the complete mess produced by mr browns endless tinkering mr cable said of all pensioners were now paying marginal tax rates of and oneandahalf million hard working families were paying marginal tax rates with that record he asked why ministers attacked lib dem plans for a new tax rate for the very rich those earning more than a year mr brown earmarked bn to help keep down council tax rises next year but the lib dem spokesman questioned whether that money was being found from cuts to education and health he urged the government to scrap the grossly unfair tax completely the lib dems want it replaced with a local income tax in response mr brown stressed the iraq money came from a reserve funds it was because he had rejected previous lib dem proposals such as scrapping the new deal that britains economy was successful claimed mr brown blair backs preelection budget tony blair has backed chancellor gordon browns prebudget report amid opposition claims he was too bullish about the state of the uk economy in a speech in edinburgh the prime minister said thursdays report reinforced stability and opportunity and that would be central to labours next election campaign planning for which was already well advanced mr brown earlier denied his economic forecasts were too optimistic but refused to rule out future tax rises he told bbc radio s today programme no politician should make the mistake that john major and his colleagues made in of saying no matter what the circumstances are they can make all sorts of guarantees on every individual thing that is not what politicians should do it would not be responsible to do mr brown insisted his spending plans were affordable and he could afford to be optimistic because britain was now a stable lowinflation economy and house prices were now stabilising mr blair praised his chancellor for his role in creating economic stability which he said was the cornerstone of labours programme in a speech at edinburghs napier university he said labour would publish over the next few months a rich agenda for future policy in any possible third term in every area of work there is a detailed plan for the future much clearer than those in or all of it fits together around common themes of opportunity security and stability for all mr blair said in his prebudget report mr brown surprised some city experts by forecasting uk growth at between and for next year many believe the figure is more likely to be under and fear tax rises or spending cuts saying tax receipts have been overestimated carl emmerson from the institute for fiscal studies told bbc news he thinks everything will come out in the wash and it will in fact be ok were not so sure david page of investec securities said his forecast that he will meet the golden rule with a margin of bn is way too optimistic its going to take a significant turnaround in the economy to meet these targets conservative shadow chancellor oliver letwin said i cant find a single economic forecaster from the imf to the institute of fiscal studies who believes anything other than the chancellor has got a black hole in his finances in order to deal with that he will have to raise taxes after the next general election mr letwin accused the chancellor of using fancy statistics to hide public service failures vincent cable for the liberal democrats called on mr brown to open up the governments books to the national audit office to see if he had met his golden rule it is very clear that there are some serious loose ends in government public spending mr cable told mps cabinet anger at brown cash raid ministers are unhappy about plans to use whitehall cash to keep council tax bills down local government minister nick raynsford has acknowledged gordon brown reallocated m from central to local government budgets in his prebudget report on thursday mr raynsford said he had held some pretty frank discussions with fellow ministers over the plans but he said local governments had to deliver good services without big council tax rises the central government cash is part of a bn package to help local authorities in england keep next years council tax rises below in what is likely to be a general election year mr raynsford said nearly all central government departments had an interest in well run local authorities and he confirmed rows over the issue with ministerial colleagues obviously we had some pretty frank discussions about this he told bbc radio s the world at one but he said there was a recognition that a good settlement for local government was important to health education and other government departments ministers had to be sure local government could deliver without unreasonable council tax increases he added mr raynsford dismissed a suggestion the move was designed to keep council taxes down ahead of an expected general election this is a response to the concerns that have been voiced by local government about the pressures they face mr raynsford also plans to make savings of m by making changes to local government pensions schemes these would raise the age from which retiring workers could claim their pensions and limit how much they received if they retired early he insisted the changes were very modest and designed to tackle the problem of workers retiring very early but general secretary of the public services union unison dave prentis criticised the plans if you want world class public services you dont get that by hitting people as they approach retirement brown ally rejects budget spree chancellor gordon browns closest ally has denied suggestions there will be a budget giveaway on march ed balls exchief economic adviser to the treasury said there would be no spending spree before polling day but mr balls a prospective labour mp said he was confident the chancellor would meet his fiscal rules he was speaking as sir digby jones cbi director general warned mr brown not to be tempted to use any extra cash on preelection bribes mr balls who stepped down from his treasury post to stand as a labour candidate in the election had suggested that mr brown would meet his golden economic rule with a margin to spare he said he hoped more would be done to build on current tax credit rules he also stressed rise in interest rates ahead of an expected may election would not affect the labour partys chances of winning expectations of a rate rise have gathered pace after figures showed house prices are still rising consumer borrowing rose at a nearrecord pace in january if the mpc the bank of englands monetary policy committee were to judge that a rate rise was justified before the election because of the strength of the economy and im not predicting that they will i do not believe that this will be a big election issue in britain for labour he told a parliamentary lunch this is a big change in our political culture during an interview with bbc radio s today programme mr balls said he was sure mr browns budget would not put at risk the stability of the economy i dont think well see a preelection spending spree we certainly did not see that before he said his assurances came after sir digby jones said stability was all important and any extra cash should be spent on improving workers skills his message to the chancellor was please dont give it away in any form of electioneering sir digby added i dont think he will i have to say he has been a prudent chancellor right the way through stability is the key word british business needs boring stability more than anything we would say to him dont increase your public spending dont give it away but if you are going to anywhere just add something to the competitiveness of britain put it into skilling our people that would be a good way to spend any excess mr balls refused to say whether mr brown would remain as chancellor after the election amid speculation he will be offered the job of foreign secretary i think that gordon brown wants to be part of the successful labour government which delivers in the third term for the priorities of the people and sees off a conservative party that will take britain backwards mr balls told today prime minister tony blair has yet to name the date of the election but most pundits are betting on may will the budget bring out smiling voters as tory spokesman oliver letwin said any chancellor would use his preelection budget to offer some vote winning sweeteners wouldnt he and everyone does indeed expect gordon brown to do just that in his last budget before the expected polling day of may there will be plenty of talk about taking no risks with the economy or handing out irresponsible giveaways but mr brown will stun westminster and break just about every historical precedent if he fails to do something designed to put a smile on voters faces and make them more inclined to back labour in the election and there has already been speculation about possible tax reductions for the poorest and increasing the threshold on stamp duty in this weeks budget the aim of his package will be to keep any disillusioned core labour voters in the fold while ensuring the middle england voters who gave tony blair two election victories dont desert him at the third poll and needless to say there will be plenty of analysis of what impact the budget will have on mr browns own ambitions to replace mr blair as prime minister at some point after a third win but there is a shadow hanging over this preelection performance in the shape of billion or thereabouts that is the size of the financial black hole the tories backed by some independent forecasters believe mr brown will have to fill with tax increases after the election the opening shot in that battle was fired at the weekend with claims a treasury leak suggested mr brown was ready to slap capital gains tax on home sales to raise some of that cash it was immediately denied but the tories remain suspicious claiming that as mr letwin said if the money does not come from there where will it come from mr brown will undoubtedly claim the forecasts are simply wrong and that he will have absolutely no need to raise taxes after the election should labour win previous gloomy forecasts proved wrong he will argue while suggesting that only by sticking with him can britain continue to have a sound economy low unemployment and high public spending the opposition will reject that by claiming they can keep the economy sound increase spending and cut taxes at the same time the liberal democrats will also promise to run a sound economy but based on increased taxes to fund spending and amongst other things abolishing the council tax in favour of a local income tax and there will be prolonged argument over which of the parties can make the greatest savings in whitehall and beyond to fund their policies but probably what that all boils down to is a simple question of which of the parties the voters most trust to keep the economy stable and avoid any unpleasant surprises in the coming years and it is probably still the answer to that one question that will overwhelmingly decide the outcome of the general election brown comes out shooting labour may have abolished hunting but that didnt stop chancellor gordon brown using his budget to fire both barrels at some of the opposition parties core election foxes specifically it saw him attempting to slaughter the council tax as an election issue and to tear limb from limb their wider policies for pensioners and families in a relatively short speech he kept the best for last and was clearly out to give exactly that preelection boost everyone had been predicting so if you are a couple with children a pensioner a patient or a youngster there was something pulled from mr browns red box in an attempt to persuade you to stick with or switch to a new labour government like a surgeon he attempted to target his handouts with absolute precision onto exactly the groups the government needs to appeal to in the election campaign the announcements brought great cheers from his own mps who are now in fullon election mode and had been looking to their man to give them ammunition for the doorsteps they obviously believed he had done that for them and coincidentally given his own image as a prime ministerinwaiting another little boost labour mps for example will undoubtedly now engage in a debate over exactly how redistributive a lovely old labour word this chancellor really is but gordon brown is never going to put on a show and even as he was out to cast himself as the man who will win labour an historic third term his demeanour remained quiet confident and reassuring prudence made an appearance albeit towards the end of his address as he assured voters he would do nothing to mess up the economic stability he had brought to britain and which he claimed would be thrown away by anyone else according to the opposition parties however it is all one big con trick as always they accused him of glossing over the facts of the black hole at the centre of his finances which they claim would ensure tax increases after the election he did it most obviously with his increase in national insurance contributions after the election campaign during which he had pledged not to increase income tax as liberal democrat leader charles kennedy claimed for most families the distinction between income tax and a tax on income is meaningless tory leader michael howard said the chancellor was up to his old trick of deliberately recasting his forecasts to give the illusion that everything in the treasury larder is as fresh as the day it was first stored away for future use he branded it a dodgy vote now pay later budget based on dodgy figures from a dodgy government that gave britain the dodgy dossier where the chancellor mostly avoided direct electioneering mr howard felt no such constraint with attacks like comparing mr browns forecasts to the prime ministers forecasts on iraqs weapons of mass destruction as ever there will now be a period of frantic activity by the opposition parties treasury specialists as they pore over the chancellors red book which sets out the fine detail of his budget in an attempt to spot the flaws in particular there will be an argument over precisely whose policies on the council tax will offer people the best deal and in labour circles there will undoubtedly be an argument over just how good a prime minister gordon brown will make at some point after the next election howard attacks pay later budget tory leader michael howard has dismissed gordon browns budget as vote now pay later spending plans the simple fact was that under a new labour government taxes would go up after the election to plug a financial black hole mr howard said everyone could see the chancellors sweeteners but these hid tax rises for hard working families he said labours faltering election campaign would not be helped by the package of measures mr howard added mr browns budget was not about what was good for the country but all about the interests of the labour party the tory leader said after mockingly welcoming the chancellor back to the election campaign he went on to accuse mr brown of giving with one hand while taking away with the other he urged the chancellor to admit he had been responsible for dragging millions of people in to the net to pay stamp duty and inheritance tax we can all see the sweeteners but they hide the crippling tax rises for hardworking families that are inevitable if labour wins he also accused the government and the chancellor of running out of solutions to the problems britain faced their only answer is to tax to spend and to waste to get people to vote now and pay later mr brown liked to rattle off magical balances conjured out of thin air in a bid to convince people there was no black hole in the nations finances the tory leader said this dodgy government that brought us the dodgy dossier is now publishing a dodgy budget based on dodgy numbers he said you now propose to borrow over the next six years no less than billion so much for prudence the chancellors forecasts of surpluses are no better than the prime ministers forecasts of weapons of mass destruction mr browns council tax rebate for pensioners was less than what the tories were offering mr howard said there was nothing in the budget that would put more police on the streets make hospitals cleaner or give parents and teachers the discipline and skills they wanted in schools people would face a clear choice at the election either more waste and higher taxes under labour or lower taxes and value for money with the conservatives he said thats the battleground of this election thats what this election is going to be all about and i say bring it on he concluded to loud tory cheering whitehall cuts ahead of target thousands of civil service jobs have already been cut or moved out of london as part of a major costcutting drive chancellor gordon brown said jobs had gone while were being moved out of the south east he plans to axe jobs to free up money for education health defence housing and overseas aid unions oppose the plans but mr brown said bn savings had already been made and more jobs had been cut than had been expected at this stage a further jobs at the department of the environment food and rural affairs have been earmarked to be cut at the department for work and pensions jobs are to go will be lost by the end of the month at the department of trade and industry and are to go at the inland revenue and customs in his budget statement the chancellor said the first civil service jobs had been cut on target about civil servants will leave london and the south east by the end of march and there are plans to relocate another of those department of health posts will go to yorkshire while hundreds at the department of culture will move to birmingham and newcastle mr brown also announced plans to merge agencies into nine described by one civil service union as a bonfire of the quangos mark serwotka the leader of the public and commercial services union said in last years budget we had the day of the long knifes as the chancellor kicked off the crude game of who could cut the most civil service jobs between the government and the tories there was a time when the only worry thousands of hard working civil and public servants had on budget day was whether petrol or taxes would go up nowadays the worry is whether they will have a job by the end of it he said mr brown had made welcome announcements on closing tax loopholes and extending the new deal while cutting the very people who deliver them the treasury also announced plans to reduce the number of public sector workers on sick leave with a new system of checks and tougher measures against those suspected of abusing the system brown calls for bn aids fund gordon brown has called on rich nations to fund a bn bn plan to fight the aids epidemic and find a vaccine on the fourth day of his sixday tour of africa the uk chancellor predicted a vaccine could be found by if the world stepped up its funding pledges doubling the m being spent yearly on finding such a vaccine could advance it by three years and save six million lives mr brown said on thursday he hopes to use the uks g presidency to push the issue forward i believe that the generation that provided the finance to combat cure and eradicate the worlds deadliest disease of today and today the worlds least curable disease hivaids will rightly earn the title the great generation mr brown said in a speech during his african tour the problems of hivaids were inseparable from poverty he added at least billion per annum bn is needed to address the hivaids crisis in low and middle income countries existing financial commitments on their own will not stop the pandemic the uks proposal for an international finance facility is so important increasing world aid flows by over billion bn a doubling of world aid to halve world poverty mr brown also said he had agreed with the italian finance minister domenico siniscalco to push forward with plans for the worldwide sharing and coordination of research into the disease currently the private sector was only spending m a year on seeking an inoculation and the market needed boosting mr brown said he called on industrialised nations to commit themselves to buying the first m vaccines at a cost of each thereby boosting the market for inoculations this would be a large enough inducement to create much stronger interest from both large and small pharmaceutical firms mr brown added more must also be done to finance the treatment and care of those living with hivaids and their families he said but aid charity actionaid criticised mr browns preoccupation with finding a vaccine and called on g nations to fund hivaids treatments the charitys head of hivaids in britain simon wright said while encouraging the pharmaceutical industry to discover an hiv vaccine is important a failure to provide any funding for hiv treatments condemns a generation of people to death hiv is decimating african countries killing the most productive adults who should be working caring for children and building the economy an hiv vaccine is probably at least years away treatments are needed now on wednesday mr brown visited slums in the kenyan capital nairobi he will visit an hivaids orphanage in tanzania and a womens credit union in mozambique before chairing a meeting of the commission for africa in cape town the chancellor has already unveiled proposals for a g aid package which he has likened to the marshall plan used by the united states to rebuild europe after world war two act on detention ruling uk urged the government must act quickly on the law lords ruling that detention of foreign terror suspects without trial is unlawful mary robinson has said the former un commissioner for human rights and irish president told radio s today the governments response would be scrutinised internationally it would be very troubling if the government did not accept the judgement and then work within it she said home secretary charles clarke has said detainees will not be freed at present speaking to parliament on his first day in office as home secretary following david blunketts resignation mr clarke said i will be asking parliament to renew this legislation in the new year in the meantime we will be studying the judgement carefully to see whether it is possible to modify our legislation to address the concerns raised by the house of lords mrs robinson said the law lords ruling was in line with international legal opinion and praised their very decisive eight to one majority what the law lords did was acknowledge the role of the government but say that there had been a disproportionate use that it amounted to executive detention and it was discriminatory because it didnt apply to british citizens she said mrs robinson warned that a lack of action by the british government could lead to further action in legal arenas such as the european court of human rights in strasbourg if the government were not to accept this ruling then there is further redress including possible damages for the individuals who could claim that the government either was tardy or was resisting the implications of the judgement of the law lords she said a meeting of the club of madrid a group of former world leaders to be held in the spanish capital on the march anniversary of the train bombings there would probably discuss the ruling and its implications i have no doubt that this judgement will be looked at both as a very positive step in clarifying the law and restating the fundamental principles but also the response of the british government will be under quite a clear international scrutiny there the detainees took their case to the house of lords after the court of appeal backed the home offices powers to hold them without limit or charge the government opted out of part of the european convention on human rights concerning the right to a fair trial in order to bring in antiterrorism legislation in response to the september attacks in the us any foreign national suspected of links with terrorism can be detained or can opt to be deported the law lords said the rules were incompatible with the european convention on human rights as they allowed detentions in a way that discriminates on the ground of nationality or immigration status the case was heard by a panel of nine law lords rather than the usual five because of the constitutional importance of the case baa support ahead of court battle uk airport operator baa has reiterated its support for the governments aviation expansion plans to airports throughout the country the comments come a day ahead of a high court challenge by residents groups and local councils to the governments white paper the judicial review will centre on government plans for expansion at heathrow stansted and luton airports baa which operates all three said it was consulting with local communities we areconsulting on voluntary compensation schemes which go beyond our statutory obligations a baa spokesman said groups challenging the plans include stop stansted expansion heathrow antinoise campaigners hacan clearskies and the london boroughs of hillingdon and wandsworth at heathrow gatwick edinburgh and glasgow airports baa launched a series of consultations on blight to properties from the proposed expansion in september which will close next week the company is also offering to buy noisehit properties for an indexlinked unblighted price among other measures baa has set up a homeowner support scheme for people living near stansted and has launched a special scheme for those close to the airport but far enough away not to be covered by the homeowner scheme at heathrow baa said it was working closely with all interested parties to see how the strict environmental air quality and noise targets for a third runway can be met at gatwick the company has written to homes and business likely to be affected by any extra runway stop stansted expansion said the white paper published in december was fundamentally flawed and did not follow the proper consultation process we do not underestimate the scale of the challenge before us because the courts have never before overturned a government white paper said stop stansted expansion chairman peter sanders said hacan chairman john stewart said almost exactly a year ago the government published its year aviation white paper with much fanfare it hoped that would be the end of the debate and it could proceed with its plans for a massive expansion of aviation yet a year later the protesters are still here and stronger than ever a judgement from mr justice sullivan is expected early in february uk discriminated against roma the governments immigration rules racially discriminated against roma gypsies seeking entry into the uk the law lords have ruled it follows a home office move to cut asylum claims by stopping people mostly roma from boarding flights to britain from the czech capital prague civil rights group liberty said it exposed racism at the heart of the governments asylum policy the home office said it had not meant to discriminate against anyone it said it would look at the implications of the ruling but pointed out the controls were no longer in place because czechs are now entitled to free movement across europe the screening took place at the airport in july at a time of concern about the number of asylum seekers entering britain those refused preclearance were effectively prevented from travelling to the uk because no airline would carry them lady hale sitting with lords bingham steyn hope and carswell said many roma had good reason to want to leave the czech republic because of persecution but she said they were treated more sceptically than nonroma passengers by immigration officers acting on racial grounds lady hale said immigration officers should have treated all wouldbe passengers in the same way only using more intrusive questioning if there was a specific reason liberty said statistics suggested roma czechs were times more likely to be stopped by british immigration officials at prague airport than nonroma czechs it took up the case of six unnamed roma czechs refused entry to britain and that of the european roma rights centre which said the measures unfairly penalised roma people it lost a high court action in october when a judge said the system was no more or less objectionable than a visa control system he ruled there was no obligation on britain not to take steps to prevent a potential refugee from approaching its border to claim asylum the court of appeal then decided the practice almost inevitably discriminated against roma but that this was justified because they were more likely to seek asylum immigration law allows officials to discriminate against citizens from named countries but it does not allow officers to go further than that responding to the ruling a home office spokesman said the scheme was operated two years ago as a shortterm response to the high levels of passengers travelling from prague who are subsequently found to be ineligible for entry to the uk welcoming the ruling maeve sherlock chief executive of the refugee council said human rights abuses against the roma in eastern europe are well documented and it is hugely troubling that the government sought to deny entry to such a vulnerable group amnesty internationals jan shaw said that the governments own asylum policy was being operated discriminatorily is bleakly ironic given that discrimination often lies at the heart of serious human rights abuse not least in the czech republic but the chairman of migration watch uk sir andrew green said the house of lords decision was a step in the wrong direction the basic point is that the government has a duty to control our borders and this decision appears to extend the race relations legislation beyond sensible limits howard pitches for uk ethnic vote michael howard is to make a pitch for britains ethnic vote urging people who feel taken for granted by tony blair to vote conservative he will say conservatives share the same values as the uks minorities and that he wants to build a better britain where everyone whatever the colour of their skin or religion can make the most of their talents but the tory leader will argue against positive discrimination saying it is outdated and unjust it sets family against family and it leads ethnic communities to doubt their own abilities he will argue mr howard himself the son of immigrants will acknowledge that racial discrimination still exists in the uk people from ethnic communities for example still earn less than their white counterparts he will say before arguing the answer to helping everyone to get on was free enterprise free trade free speech the tory leader will also call for religious tolerance arguing that hindus and sikhs as well as muslims got caught in the downdraft of islamaphobia which was one of the terrible side effects of mr howard will make his speech during a visit to support tory parliamentary hopefuls robert light and sayeeda warsi the first british muslim woman selected to run for mp as a conservative candidate he will attack labours record in government over issues such as tax and he will set out tory plans for an immigration quota to be set by mps mr howard will also attack the lib dems for wanting to abolish faith schools introduce compulsory sex education from the age of seven and give contraceptives out in schools from the age of so i say to all those people from ethnic minorities who feel mr blair and the liberal democrats take their votes for granted come join us he will say lib dem president simon hughes branded mr howard arrogant and wrong for claiming the tories were the natural party for britains ethnic minorities given the tories considerably reduced support in urban areas where many black and asian britons live during their time in power the evidence simply does not support his claims that the conservatives are the party for these communities he said observers to monitor uk election ministers will invite international observers to check the forthcoming uk general election is fairly run the move comes amid claims the poll could be marred by electoral fraud a report by two mps committees called on thursday for urgent changes to the electoral registration system to combat vote rigging and boost turnout but in a written response to labour mp gordon prentice the government said it would normally invite observers to any uk election junior constitutional affairs minister christopher leslie said i fully expect us to repeat our previous practice of doing so once the date for the next general election is announced the government has looked at ways of boosting voter turnout which fell to in the last general election in but trial allpostal ballots in four english regions last summer were hit by delays and some fraud allegations liberal democrat peer lord greaves called last week for international observers at the general election saying otherwise there could be months of court challenges on a scale not seen since the th century thursdays report was drawn up by two committees scrutinising the work of the office of the deputy prime minister odpm and the department for constitutional affairs dca it said that with the growth of postal voting there was a strong case to tighten up fraud protection by requiring voters to register individually rather than by household it also said about three million people eligible to vote are not registered to do so figures for the general election suggest of people aged between and and of black voters were not on the electoral roll young people in shared accommodation are thought to miss out because no one acts as head of the household to fill in the form odpm committee chairman andrew bennett said individual voter registration as opposed to registration by household should be quickly introduced as it could dramatically reduce the chances of fraud but his counterpart on the dca committee alan beith said it should be delayed until measures likely to increase registration have been put in place and proved effective shadow constitutional affairs secretary oliver heald accused the government of dragging its feet over this badly needed measure it is vital that we move ahead with the northern ireland system of individual electoral registration to safeguard the integrity of the britains electoral system he said the report said individual registration should be treated carefully as of voters disappeared from the electoral roll in northern ireland when it was introduced in the report said the government should consider fines for unregistered voters but accepted many experts said it would be an expensive system that would be hard to enforce it said incentives to register such as council tax rebate were likely to be seen as gimmicks and risked undermining the integrity of the system mps said instead they called for imaginative campaigns to boost interest uk rebate unjustified chirac french president jacques chirac has called the uks bn rebate from the european union unjustified speaking after a summit meeting he said unless it was put up for discussion the eu would never be able to reach agreement on its medium term finances earlier foreign secretary jack straw said the uk was prepared to veto any bid to reduce the rebate secured by margaret thatcher in he said it remained justified because less eu farm money came to the uk mr chirac told reporters in brussels one can only have a reasonable budgetary balance if we put back on the table the british cheque it can no longer be justified it was from the past but a uk government official responded even with the rebate the uk pays two and a half times more than france contributes to the eu budget without it we would pay times as much as france there can be no deal on future financing which does not protect the rebate the member eu is gearing up for tough negotiations on its budget plans for the period with the blocs luxembourg presidency hoping to strike a deal at a june summit earlier conservative graham brady said the rebate was a crucial test of how firmly ministers were prepared to stand up for britain eu commission president jose manuel barroso has indicated he wants the rebate to come to an end mr straw said that as well as the veto over the rebate the uk wanted to keep a tight rein on national contributions the uk france germany austria the netherlands and sweden want the eu budget to be capped at of member states combined national incomes the european commission has urged an increase to mr straw has said the eu commissions proposal would mean a hike in the budget shadow europe minister mr brady said i believe it is essential that britain keeps the rebate and i think its a crucial test of how firmly the british government is prepared to stand up for britain internationally in europe the uk is already one of the biggest net contributors to the eu the foreign secretary meanwhile said the justice of the rebate remained we have one of the lowest net receipts of any eu country because of the relatively small size of our agriculture sector and its efficiency that continues to be the case uk independence party leader roger knapman said the rebate was set in stone and there was no reason to negotiate about it it is extraordinary to do it at this time just as we are becoming the biggest contributor to the eu if we lose our rebate as well the british taxpayer is going to be bled at such a rate that i think everyone will go off the european project eu leaders are holding talks in brussels on how to reenergise the sluggish european economy uk prime minister tony blair is meeting his eu counterparts to finalise a package of measures aimed at stimulating growth and boosting employment ahead of a series of referendums on the european constitution the plans could introduce a free market into everything from computer services to construction critics including germany and france believe liberalisation could result in companies shifting staff to cheaper bases in eastern europe undercutting large eu economies and undermining social protections there are also concerns about the number of workers from eastern european countries who will head west exacerbating the already high unemployment levels in germany mr straw insisted there was nothing to fear from the services directorate european countries overall have benefited hugely from the free market in goods he said what we are now talking about is developing that market into an internal market in services britains low unemployment meant there was less neurosis about people coming from eastern european countries in countries like germany and france where frankly because of a tighter social market they have much higher levels of unemployment there is increasing anxiety about other people coming in he said uk needs tax cuts tories insist a major change of direction is needed in britain if it is to prosper the shadow chancellor said as the tory party spring conference began oliver letwin said the uk could not compete with other countries without the bn tax cuts he was promising tory cochairman liam fox had opened the forum in brighton with an attack on labours record and party leader michael howard is due to speak later tony blair has said conservative policies would cause economic failure but mr letwin said britain had fallen from fourth to th in the international economic competitiveness league can this country compete can this country prosper unless we do something about the burden of regulation and tax on our economy he said if we are going to take on the great challenges the challenges like those posed by the chinese and the indians we have got to do something about getting down the burden of regulation and getting down the burden of tax he said the fact is the very carefully costed fully funded plans we have laid out for saving bn by are absolutely crucial to delivering an economy that will prosper and provide people with jobs and indeed provide the public services with the money they need on a sustainable longterm basis mr letwin said voting for labour meant choosing higher taxes borrowing and waste earlier dr fox had said labours rule had been characterised by lost trust and failure to deliver he also attacked the governments failure to control immigration and asylum and criticised its record on the nhs telling delegates labour cannot be trusted on education or crime a tory government would sort out the shambles of immigration put patients before statistics and bring discipline to schools he said michael howard who had been due to welcome delegates to the conference on friday will address them in a lunchtime speech his welcome address had to be postponed after he stayed in london to lead the partys opposition to the prevention of terrorism bill in its lengthy progress through parliament the bill was finally passed on friday evening after more than hours of debate mr howard is likely to defend his partys handling of the bill which was only passed after the conservatives accepted prime minister tony blairs promise that mps would be able to review it within a year brown targets oaps and homebuyers gordon brown has doubled the level at which house buyers pay stamp duty to as he put the economy at the heart of labours election campaign the chancellor also unveiled a oneoff council tax refund for pensioners and a rise in child tax credit mr brown put p a pint on beer p on a bottle of wine and p on cigarettes but froze petrol duty until september the tories called it a vote now pay later budget the lib dems branded it a sticking plaster for the election tory leader michael howard predicted the budget would do nothing to help labours faltering election campaign this government and this chancellor have run out of solutions to the problems britain faces mr howard told mps their only answer is to tax to spend and to waste to get people to vote now and pay later he ended his response with an election challenge to labour saying bring it on liberal democrat leader charles kennedy attacked mr brown for failing to mention the environment and for his record on social justice how can it be right in britain today that the poorest pay more in tax as a proportion of their income than the richest he asked mr kennedy criticised mr brown for failing to mention the ticking bomb of council tax revaluation saying it was high time the system was replaced by a local tax based on the ability to pay during his minute speech mr brown told mps he had defied the pundits by hitting his growth target of for he said his budget struck a balance between tax cuts that are affordable investments that are essential and stability that is paramount he rejected acrosstheboard tax cuts in favour of targeted help for families the child tax credit will rise in line with earnings giving families an extra a week in contrast the personal income tax allowance will rise only in line with inflation from to next month mr brown told mps child benefit would rise to a maximum of a week for the first child and for two children despite his giveaways budget documents show mr brown clawed back m through a clampdown on tax avoidance and increased revenue from a windfall tax on oil companies he also scrapped stamp duty relief for commercial property in disadvantaged areas a measure brought in just over three years ago bbc political editor andrew marr suggested the sweeteners were not big enough to have a transforming effect on voters but trust in mr browns economic stewardship would be a central election issue he said mr brown also unveiled plans for a memorial to the queen mother funded through a special coin to celebrate the queens th birthday other measures include equal tax status for samesex couples and a deal with the council of mortgage lenders to boost low cost home ownership the level where people start paying inheritance tax will also rise from to from april mr brown said he had met his financial golden rule with a bn surplus and he said public borrowing would continue to fall over the next five years the economy had grown for consecutive quarters he said and was forecast to continue doing so over the next year with a forecast of to in and to in the first bn of valueformoney savings identified in the gershon review have been achieved the chancellor said some civil servant posts have been axed and relocated out of the south east of england he added snp leader alex salmond said mr brown had failed the tartan test as there were no measures to boost the scottish economy simon thomas of plaid cymru called it a budget for middle england uk independence party leader roger knapman attacked the plans for pensioners saying they needed more money and the dignity of being allowed to spend it how they want not free bus rides the green party said the budget was a wasted opportunity for environmental protection adding brown obviously has an eye on the coming election and has taken his eye off the needs of the planet mps demand budget leak answers ministers have been asked to explain how budget details were printed in a london newspaper half an hour before gordon brown made his speech the tories said a large chunk of the budget appeared to have been leaked in what they describe as a serious breach of treasury confidentiality the lib dems called for commons leader peter hain to make a statement and said chancellors had resigned over leaks they were told it would be brought to speaker michael martins attention in the commons tory frontbencher andrew tyrie mp demanded an immediate ministerial statement about how measures had been clearly or at least apparently leaked to the evening standard raising a point of order he said it was the latest in a long line of discourtesies to this house as well as a breach of confidentiality he said i can only hope it is unintentional if it were planned it would be a very grave matter indeed a previous labour chancellor resigned after he leaked the budget hugh dalton resigned after leaking details of his budget to journalist john carvel who published them in a london newspaper just minutes before they were announced to the house of commons liberal democrat david laws said it was a very serious matter and said mr hain should make a statement on thursday deputy speaker sylvia heal agreed it was of concern but said nothing could be done immediately but the issue would be brought to mr martins attention us casino tricks face ban in uk controversial new uk casinos will be banned from using american tricks of the trade to ensure they are socially responsible it has been suggested culture secretary tessa jowell said proposed supercasinos will be different from their us counterparts in america pheromones have reportedly been released from machines to encourage aggressive gambling and clocks are often removed from walls eight supercasinos are proposed from if the gambling bill becomes law ms jowell said the legislation would ban psychological trickery she told the times british casinos will be quite different to those overseas they will have to act in a socially responsible way and will be tightly regulated they will be run according to british rules and well simply not allow any tricks which people are subjected to unawares and which increase the risk of problem gambling one tactic used in the us is simulating daylight during nighttime to lull players into remaining at the tables and slot machines casinos also frequently offer free food drink and hotel accommodation to keep punters betting a spokesman for the british casino association which represents the uk industry said the government was trying to allay fears over a uk las vegas he said the way the licences were being awarded meant uk firms were at a massive disadvantage and foreign companies would be certain to win the contracts the uk industry is one of the worlds most respected he said we have the lowest level of problem gambling in the world we certainly dont use pheremones the uk gambling industry is being totally frozen in time and the foreign companies will take over blair defends terror law changes the prime minister has defended measures to allow house arrest without trial saying several hundred people in the uk are plotting terror attacks the government is facing opposition from tory and lib dem mps and its own backbenchers as it prepares for the final commons debate on the changes but tony blair said there could be no concession on the basic principle mr blair told the bbc the control orders would only be used in the most limited circumstances critics in the opposition and civil rights activists are worried that the home secretary will have the power to issue the detention orders but the government has so far resisted pressure for judges to be responsible for making the orders instead saying judges will be able to quash them an explanation is being sent by home secretary charles clarke to all mps and peers ahead of the final debate in the house of commons on sunday conservative shadow home secretary david davis claimed judges would get the powers to issue detention orders and liberal democrat leader charles kennedy said some concessions had already been offered by the government during lastminute negotiations some labour mps voted against the legislation last week barbara follett whose first husband was killed while under house arrest in south africa during the apartheid era confirmed she would vote against the government but the government is continuing to insist that control orders must be issued by the home secretary mr blair told bbc radio s womans hour we are being advised by the police and the security services what they say is you have got to give us powers in between mere surveillance of these people there are several hundred of them in this country who we believe are engaged in plotting or trying to commit terrorist acts you have got to give us power in between just surveying them and being able being sure enough of the proof to prosecute them beyond reasonable doubt and these will be restrictions on their liberty that we will use only in the most limited circumstances a yougov poll in the daily telegraph suggested of respondents thought action was sometimes necessary against people who had not committed an offence but who had been found by intelligence services to be planning a terrorist attack but tory leader michael howard told bbc news that the government was again making a mistake in rushing antiterrorism legislation i very much hope it would be possible to reach a compromise on this he said after meeting tony blair he had been left with the impression that he really wasnt interested in any of the various proposals we have put forward mr clarke wants house arrest and other powers to replace indefinite jail for terror suspects something the law lords have ruled against on the basis that it breaches human rights bbc political correspondent vicky young said some form of concession on the measures was likely to be needed to get the legislation through the house of lords where labour does not have a majority and would require support from other parties shami chakrabarti director of civil liberties pressure group liberty said who was able to issue the control orders was not the main issue she said the legislation was a travesty and a perversion of justice and would remain unpalatable even if a judge was involved early in the process election could be terror target terrorists might try to target the uk in the runup to the election londons most senior police officer has said sir ian blair said terror groups would remember the effect of the madrid bomb on spains general election last year other potential targets were the royal wedding and the uks presidency of the european union and g he said he refused to say if there was specific information about the risk of a prepoll attack no was similarly cautious but said the threat was real the comments come after tony blair defended his controversial antiterror proposals warning that it would be wrong to wait for an attack before acting sir ian told a meeting of the metropolitan police authority it would be unwise to speculate about whether there was specific information about risks of a preelection attack but he said terrorists have long memories they understand what happened in madrid and know what the impact of that was on the spanish electorate this year we are responsible for the eu presidency presidency of the g a royal wedding and a general election there are obvious and enormous targets which we have to deal with sir ian said the debate over antiterror plans was one for politicians not the police who would enforce any new powers home secretary charles clarke has also warned that a madridstyle preelection bombing could happen in the uk too asked about sir ians comments the prime ministers official spokesman said we believe the threat is real the spokesman declined to comment on whether the security services had received specific intelligence relating to a possible attack during the election campaign he said no did not disclose any security advice they received earlier writing in the daily telegraph the prime minister conceded that plans to detain suspects under house arrest without trial were difficult issues for any government the commons has approved the measures despite considerable opposition with the governments majority more than halved as labour rebels joined tory and lib dem opposition but mr blair insisted there is no greater civil liberty than to live free from terrorist attack tory leader michael howard has accused mr blair of steamrolling the house arrest plans and of using national security for political point scoring liberal democrat leader charles kennedy says that the plan is a further example of labours authoritarian response to crises the prevention of terrorism bill proposes control orders which as well as house arrest could impose curfews tagging or bans on telephone and internet use they would replace current powers to detain foreign terror suspects without trial which the law lords have ruled against but critics are concerned that it would be the home secretary and not judges who decided to impose control orders the plans face further commons scrutiny on monday before passing to the lords minimum wage increased to the minimum wage will rise in october benefiting more than m people the government has announced adults must be paid at least an hour up from while to year olds will be paid the recommendations came from the low pay commission which said the number of jobs had continued to grow since the minimum wage was introduced in businesses wanted it frozen warning more rises could damage competitiveness but the unions want a rate a further increase in the adult rate to an hour is provisionally scheduled for october according to the commission many businesses had found the last two significant increases in the minimum wage challenging we have therefore recommended only a slight increase above average earnings and concentrated it in the second year to allow business more time to absorb the impact said chairman adair turner the government says most of those on the minimum wage are women with many working in cleaning catering shops and hairdressing unveiling the latest increase mr blair said he wanted the minimum wage to become a symbol of decency and fairness for too long poverty pay capped the aspiration and prosperity of far too many hardworking families he said too often people were told to make a choice between the indignity of unemployment or the humiliation of poverty pay chancellor gordon brown and transport secretary alistair darling promoted the news in edinburgh wales secretary peter hain and welsh first minister rhodri morgan in cardiff and northern ireland minister john spellar in belfast the government has not accepted the commissions recommendation that yearolds should be paid at the adult rate but says it will look again at the rate later on mr brown said we want to do nothing that can damage the employment opportunities for young people particularly young people entering the labour market for the first time the government has said it will look at tougher action against the small number of employers who consistently refuse to pay the minimum wage the national minimum wage is currently set at per hour for those aged and above and at for those aged to a per hour minimum wage was introduced last october for to yearolds but apprentices are exempt the trade unions congress welcomed the increase but has called for a minimum wage by next year but the confederation of british industry cbi called for a pause year to assess the impact of the above inflation rise in the minimum wage in october and david frost director of the british chambers of commerce said the level of increase each year has increased by rates far outstripping the rates of inflation what employers are saying to us now is that its at a level where its starting to bite into the competitiveness of companies right across the country the liberal democrats economics spokesman vincent cable said he supported the move to raise the minimum wage its not just good for the workers themselves but it lifts them out of benefits and therefore is good for the exchequer too he said conservative leader michael howard said he accepted the principle of the minimum wage and would not seek to disturb the increase speaking on bbc radio s womans hour mr howard hinted the tories might go into the general election with a promise to cancel income tax for the lowestpaid workers there are people on very low salaries very low incomes indeed who really shouldnt be paying income tax he said it would be better to decrease taxes on earnings below a year with say no tax on below the losses in tax can be recouped by having a pc tax band for people making over our minimum wage is going to be effectively almost twice the us minimum wage yet our economy per person is only rds of the us perhaps we have to really starting questioning why some products cost more here than they do in the us this combined with the tax decreases would make the pounds the lowpaid people do make go much further its still not good enough i got a part time job at when i was doing my alevels in an attempt to get a little money saved for uni this was only years ago and i was getting paid an hour and working as hard as any of the older staff maybe its about time year olds got a fair wage we must remember that the minimum wage is only part of the picture and must not rise to a level that makes employing people unattractive and encourages businesses to send work and therefore jobs abroad still government and local councils employ staff via their contractors that pay at the minimum wage or very close to it an easy way for the government to do as it preaches would be to insist on floor pay levels for all government workers and take tens of thousand of civil servants out of the social security system all together any increase is certainly welcome news however for all those whining about the pressures of an increase in the minimum wage i would simply ask them would you be happy to work for less than an hour thought not so then dont expect others to either i cant believe that so many of these comments are against the minimum wage also i personally take great offence at the insinuation that people earning minimum wage were lazy at school if everyone went to university then who would serve you in the supermarkets and clean up after you its about time that these hardworking people are rewarded with only what they deserve and have earned fair pay and a bit of respect wouldnt go a miss either br gt this is good news the minimum wage has put a sense of equality back into a workers relationship with their employer wages are supposed to be a fair reflection of an employees efforts for too long wages were a point of exploitation what could an employer get away with in very simplistic terms this put a pressure to keep lowpaid wages low with the minimum wage this downward pressure is at least partly removed it is also interesting to read the comments from so called business leaders they are the first to defend the rights and privileges of boards to award fatcat salaries bonuses and pension rights to the select few but they are the first to attack policies that are put in place to merely defend the rights of those that really make those fat cats purr i feel there are both negatives and positives to the increase on one hand some businesses will struggle to stay afloat but on the other hand in today world many young people cant afford to move out as property costs too much and only by earning more will they be able to get on in life its true many may get complacent but the minimum wage could be looked at as more of a stepping stone rather than a hand out here come the usual whines about how difficult it will be for businesses we all remember michael howards protestations that the minimum wage would cost a million jobs when it was introduced funny how hes gone quiet on that one jobs have continued to increase since this humane legislation was brought in i think if any job is worth doing then its worth being paid a fair wage for and is hardly a fortune if your business cannot pay its workers a decent wage then maybe its not being run properly and if it folds a betterrun company will take over its duties and employ more people so everybody wins except incompetent business owners great keep at it tony i remember the despair of the s and the low wages employers got away with at last we can make a difference to people and reward them for working we cant afford not to pay a decent wage its not a jobs at any price economy goodbye sweatshops hello decency the increase in minimum wage is a good thing living in the southwest where house prices and rent have increased hugely like the rest of the country over the past years has made living for you average years old very difficult in the south west the increase in living costs have not been matched by an increase in pay for example a job i did in plymouth was underpaid to an equivalent worker in exeter by p an hour hopefully the increase in the minimum wage will bring in to balance pay on a regional and national level and in turn allow people like myself who do work hard but might never earn a figure salary the chance to branch out on our own i work at a large hospital where the contractors providing all ancillary services domestic catering portering etc pay the minimum wage of as the basic rate someone has to do these unglamorous jobs and earn enough to live decently how dare people suggest we are lazy or complacent for accepting these jobs and these wages who do they think will be carrying out these public service jobs if contractors are allowed to pay as little as their consciences allow this is definitely the right step in the right direction it shows that this government cares for the low income earners as well this is a million votes more good strategy isnt it although i would not deny people the minimum wage increase its timing stinks i am quite prepared for a raft of bribes to come from the government before the election and a raft of taxes afterwards they are playing us for the fools they think we are this is extremely bad news for any business whether they are small and medium enterprises or even large companies by increasing overheads for business there will be an almost certain rise in costs to the consumer who while they openly welcome the idea of an increase in the minimum wage are the same people who still want to buy that shirt or that pair of trainers for next to nothing the extra cost this increase will bring will only be reflected in the price of the goods we buy which in turn will only serve to discourage companies from settingup business in the uk or encourage those companies already based here to look elsewhere the jubilation felt by lowpaid workers here will soon give way to misery as they lose their jobs this will only lead to a reduction in jobs why have many of the call centre jobs gone to india blair says the economy is strong and stable economy however consumer debt and the countrys debt is at its highest and now they heap this onto businesses that will have no choice but to cut the workforce the timing cannot be coincidental this is blatant electioneering and should be exposed as such andrew in derby complains that raising the minimum wage is blatant electioneering i dont mind if it is in our degraded democracy elections are the one time when elites really have to worry about doing something concrete for the majority my only complaint is the paltry figures being discussed if my maths is right a hour week at gives you an annual income just over and raising it to leaves it under the unions should be putting the government under pressure for much more businesses complaining might like to take a look at corporate pay shareholder payouts and profits before wondering if paying a living wage is really a controlling factor in the viability of their firm i am all for lifting the minimum wage of workers to a reasonable level but we have to accept that with this will come competition from overseas workers also small businesses will have to be able to afford this manpower cost we are already seeing a sweeping change in it work being lost to india where people are paid much less it is difficult for me to understand that only five years ago cheap labour abroad was classified as sweat shop but now we are told it is global competition with our manufacturing industry in serious decline the country cannot be entirely service industries without something tangible to serve there has to be something at the top of the food chain and that is manufacturing the whole picture needs to be looked at this is great news but that might be because i work for minimum wage seems a good idea and will hopefully be an incentive to those who live to claim to actually get a job when you can earn more from claiming than you can from work there is no incentive perhaps a step in the right direction if the tuc get their way a very large number of smes will have to close this will put more people out of work how then will the government fudge the unemployment figures the government know it is not big business that keeps the economy going but the smes but we always get overlooked they will only take notice if these large corporations close and move to other countries after all they are predominantly owned by foreign companies we are a specialist company but with these increases have already had an effect on us and we have lost work another one will close us while im delighted for those on low pay that this increase is being put forward i am extremely concerned at the implications for small businesses as an employee for a small nursery i know this increase will cause great hardship for my employer who has been unable to increase salaries for higher paid employees because of last octobers increase for the lower paid employees who were originally being paid slightly above the minimum but are now on the minimum this latest increase of p an hour will cause even more financial hardship if the rate rises to then i can foresee many small businesses having to pay off employees the increase in minimum wage will have a serious effect on my business although we pay above the minimum level we will have to increase our pay rates to maintain the differential the raise is well above inflation and without significant increases in sales it will mean that i will not be taking on a new member of staff as planned and i will be looking to reduce the total hours worked by the other members of staff overtime being the first to go i currently employ staff whose wages mirror the national minimum wage increases above inflation are fine but all of my business is conducted with local authorities who will not accept above inflation rises in my service delivery of my costs are labour the other aspect that is always hidden is that the thresholds for tax credits do not move in line with these increases so that all that happens is that employees tax credit support is reduced by the amount of the increase thereby saving the government money but increasing the financial burden on small to medium businesses it is very good that the government has decided to increase the minimum wage this should hopefully motivate people to undertake the lower status jobs i know about this great idea dont bother getting qualifications laze about at school no need to do anything other than attend so your parents dont get fined because remember when you do eventually start working doesnt matter how lazy you are youll be guaranteed a decent wage the ones who suffer are the employers i hope that if industry and business have to pay this new rate that mr blair and mr brown will increase tax allowances and raise national insurance thresholds so that the treasury wont take some of this increase off the people they say they are helping or is this just another form of stealth tax on business through the back door i dont believe in the minimum wage at all i think jobs should create their own wage value and that if people want higher wages they should earn them now before everyone thinks that i am some richkid i can assure you i am not i came from a very much working class background and started work years ago on a youth opportunity program earning per week i worked hard went to college part time got my alevels and degree bettered myself i now earn a figure salary i did that through hard work and getting off my backside a minimum wage just makes people complacent to ashley of swindon when you earned per week it was worth something these days that would need to be near to to have the equivalent buying power i might add that thanks to successive governments holding down the tax allowance threshold below inflation people earning the minimum wage are paying taxes that they never would have done years ago at equivalent wages in my day type arguments are a view that belong in the your day years ago as a graduate working for minimum wage i welcome any increase of pay i can get i disagree with ashley swindon saying i have to work harder to get more pay i have my gcses alevels and a degree and have chosen to work for a small business that cant afford the wages i should be getting i should be on at least x what im getting but they cant afford it we all work hard but the money is just not there but on the plus side i love my job and wouldnt change it just to get more pay as an employer of staff in several shops the last rise in the minimum wage cost my company an additional per year these next rises will cost me more i have to get the money from somewhere so pass it on to customers so no one really wins in the end in answer to emma from sleaford regarding no one really wins in the end on the contrary mr blair wins he wins because he obviously has announced this to be a vote winner and his treasury wins because as an employer you will know that the amount of tax and national insurance that the government will receive from all the minimum wage increases will rise and of course not only will be paying out higher wages but as an employer higher employer ni contributions as well if the minimum wage increases again and if it hits anywhere near the mark there will be more people on the employment line and one more small business going bankrupt namely mine think of us employers as well mr blair we are not all big corporations earning millions all workers should be entitled to a fair days pay for a fair days work how many people on the minimum wage have any hope of obtaining a mortgage or saving towards retirement it is good news for many asians living in uk students who do odd jobs can increase their income and can help there family in their home country i thank mr blair and his government for increase in the national minimum wage labour accused of eu propaganda a taxpayer subsidised propaganda exercise on the eu is being used to lull the british public into a false sense of security say the tories shadow foreign secretary michael ancram told mps a new white paper was part of trying to soften up opinion ahead of the referendum on the eu constitution his claims were denied by foreign secretary jack straw who accused the tories of running scared of debate eu cooperation would help get better uk immigration controls he argued mr straw used thursdays commons debate to launch the new white paper on the prospects for the eu in security stability and prosperity would be the key themes when the uk took over the chairmanship of the eu in july said mr straw africa and climate change would also feature highly he said the uk was trying to ensure future eu budgets were limited to of europes economic output and were spent where it adds most value mr straw promised to continue to ensure the uks budget rebate secured in by margaret thatcher was fully justified we like all other countries have a veto on any changes proposed in this area he said mr ancram condemned the document which the foreign office says has cost about to design print and deliver isnt the reason that the government is now involved in a taxpayer subsidised propaganda exercise to try to sell the new eu to the country in advance of the forthcoming referendum and general election he asked the tory spokesman also criticised the government for claiming the eu constitution would make europe easier to understand the government last week had to publish a commentary of pages to try and explain this easy and simple constitution to the british people he said who are they trying to kid the proposed question for the constitution referendum is should the united kingdom approve the treaty establishing a constitution for the european union the electoral commission on thursday said it was satisfied the question was easy to understand the government has suggested the referendum on the constitution could take place in spring with the tories set to campaign for a no vote mr ancram said ministers were prolonging uncertainty by putting the vote off until the latest date possible the foreign secretary hit back by saying tory attitudes to europe had helped keep the party out of power for more than a decade mr straw argued cooperation with european partners could bring a level playing field on immigration and asylum controls you are setting your face against all of these things he added for the liberal democrats sir menzies campbell said the uk should not ignore the need to reform the eu common agricultural policy change was particularly important for developing countries wanting access to markets he argued sir menzies was among those worried about plans backed by the uk to lift the arms embargo imposed on china after the tiananmen square massacre mr straw said no decisions had been taken chinese human rights had improved but not by enough terror suspects face house arrest uk citizens suspected of involvement in terrorism could face house arrest as part of a series of new measures outlined by the home secretary it comes after law lords ruled that the detention of foreign terror suspects without trial breached human rights charles clarkes planned control orders mean anyone suspected of being involved in terrorism could be subject to house arrest curfews or tagging the law society dubbed mr clarkes new proposals an abuse of power deals are already being sought to deport some of the foreign detainees who are mainly held in belmarsh prison in london under the current laws introduced after the us terror attacks on september mr clarke said efforts would continue to deport them to their countries of origin algeria tunisia egypt and jordan without them facing torture or death under the proposed changes prompted by the house of lords ruling the home secretary could order british citizens or foreign suspects who could not be deported to face house arrest or other measures such as restrictions on their movements or limits on their use of telephones and the internet british citizens are being included in the changes after the law lords said the current powers were discriminatory because they could only be used on foreign suspects mr clarke also said intelligence reports showed some british nationals were now playing a more significant role in terror threats human rights lawyer clive staffordsmith said the plans were a further abuse of human rights in britain mr clarke said prosecutions were the governments first preference and promised the powers would only be used in serious cases with independent scrutiny from judges he told mps there remains a public emergency threatening the life of the nation he accepted the law lords ruling but argued detention powers had helped prevent attacks and deter terrorists the current detainees would not be freed until the new powers were in place as they were still considered a national security threat he told mps there have been calls for the rules for wiretap and intercept evidence to be allowed to be used in courts but mr clarke refused to back that change he said intercept evidence was only a small part of the case against the men and some of it could not be used because it could put sources lives at risk most of the terror suspects are being held indefinitely at belmarsh prison in london conservative shadow home secretary david davis was worried about extending special powers to cover british citizens he warned throughout history internment has generally backfired because of the resentment it creates so unless the process is clearly just the home secretary could find himself confining one known terrorist only to recruit unknown terrorists he suggested changing the law to let securitycleared judges view evidence gathered by phonetapping could allow more terror cases to come to court liberal democrat spokesman mark oaten also backed use of wiretap evidence he said the standard of proof for the new powers would have to be very high indeed and he asked whether ministers had looked at measures which fitted with human rights laws shami chakrabarti from human rights group liberty joined calls for intercept evidence to be allowed in trials she said adherence to the rule of law should not be a game of cat and mouse the government should not swap one human rights opt out for another prepoll clash on tax and spend labour and the tories have clashed over tax and spending plans as the row over gordon browns budget turned into a full scale preelection battle tony blair claimed a tory government would cut bn from public services hitting schools hospitals and police tory chairman liam fox accused labour of at best misrepresentation at worst a downright lie and said the smear tactics were a sign of desperation the lib dems accused mr brown of ducking the issue of council tax rises appearing together at a labour poster launch the prime minister hailed his chancellors brilliant performance and he claimed the tories would cut bn from public services which was the equivalent of sacking every doctor and teacher in the uk the tories said they would not cut spending but agreed public spending would increase more slowly under their plans leading to a total of bn less spending than that anticipated by labour by but they say not a single doctor teacher or nurse will be cut dr fox said we have said we will be spending more year on year over and above inflation and to call that a cut is at best a misrepresentation at worst a downright lie tory shadow chancellor oliver letwin also predicted mr brown would have to raise taxes by bn or bn if labour was reelected because he was borrowing and spending too much for the lib dems vince cable said the chancellor had failed to deal with the looming problems of revaluation of council tax bands which he argued would result in massive increases for some mr brown and mr blair staged a show of unity on thursday morning the day after the chancellor delivered a recordbreaking ninth budget mr cable said taxation as a share of the economy would go up under all three of the main parties the chancellor meanwhile insisted his spending plans were affordable in wednesdays budget mr brown doubled the level at which homebuyers pay stamp duty unveiled a rise in child tax credit and a council tax refund for overs defending the plans he told today i will take no risks with the stability of the economy all our spending plans announced yesterday wednesday including what we can do for pensioners as well as for young families and on stamp duty and inheritance tax all these are costed and affordable in a further sign if any were needed that the election is approaching the house of commons authorities have formally told mps their offices will be deep cleaned during the threeweek poll campaign mr blair has yet to name the day but it is widely expected to be may plan to give elderly care control elderly and disabled people would choose how their own budget for personal care was spent and organised under government plans ministers say elderly and disabled people themselves not social workers should be able to decide on their care and stay in their own homes they also plan a supremo for adult services in each english area to get different agencies working together but the government shunned opponents calls for free longterm care there are m people needing care in england and ministers suggest the number could quadruple by mondays consultation paper on social care for adults in england is aimed at ending a system which generates dependency health minister stephen ladyman said this document is the antithesis of the nanny state its about taking power away from the state and giving it to individuals and saying that we will help you make these decisions but we are not going to make them for you any more the government has already allowed local councils to give people money so they can pay for their services directly but takeup of the scheme has been disappointing ministers say the new plans would make direct payments simpler and try to counter reluctance in some local councils to use the payments they also want to set up a new halfway house where social workers tell people how much money is available for their care and help them choose how to spend that individual budget the scheme will be funded on existing budgets set until but mr ladyman said the plans could deliver savings in some areas such as freeing up nhs beds and preventing illnesses he ruled out free personal care in england which is on offer in scotland and wales saying it was unsustainable david rogers from the local government association said agencies were working together on the kind of innovation proposed by the government and tony hunter president of the association of directors of social services said the plans could improve dignity and wellbeing for thousands of people but age concern argued social care was chronically underfunded and older people were being offered choice in principle but not in practice its director general gordon lishman said direct payments will not work if there are no services for people to choose from locally the tories say people who pay for three years longterm care directly or through insurance should be guaranteed free care for the rest of their lives tory spokesman simon burns said more than long term care places had been lost since after eight years of persistent change dogmatic enforcement of regulation and overbearing government initiatives we need action not a vision said mr burns the lib dems say they would fund free personal care by a new tax rate on incomes over health spokesman paul burstow said promoting independence sounds good and helping people to live in their own homes is a goal we share but the risk is that independence can turn into isolation if the right support and care is not available child access law shakeup planned parents who refuse to allow former partners contact with their children could be electronically tagged under plans being considered by ministers curfews and community service orders were other options which could be used if court orders to allow parental access were defied lord falconer said the constitutional affairs secretary outlined some of the plans on tuesday he denied fathers activists had forced the changes telling the bbc there is a recognition that something is wrong between and couples go to court to resolve access disputes each year although in nine out of separations there is no court intervention lord falconer told bbc radio s today programme he hoped voluntary mediation could help solve disputes before they reached court but he opposed compulsory mediation saying that it would lead to many people taking part with the wrong attitude other plans include parenting plans to give advice on access arrangements based on reallife examples that have worked in the past extending incourt conciliation more informal hearings before contested court cases better access to legal emotional and practical advice by telephone and internet legal aid changes to give incentives for early resolution of disputes judges can already jail parents who breach contact orders but that was a nuclear option which was rarely used as it was not seen as being in the childs interests a spokesman said the aim of the new legislation was to provide a medium range of penalties such as fines community service orders compulsory anger management or parenting classes or curfews failure to comply with these measures could result in offenders being electronically tagged on the possibility of tagging uncooperative parents lord falconer said tagging may be going too far but lets have a debate about that full details of the new powers will not be revealed until a bill is published in the next two weeks a spokesman said the governments proposals have met with disapproval from fathers rights groups john ison from the controversial group fathers justice said it is very disappointing what we have got is a cynical case of recycling existing legislation jim parton from families need fathers said the new proposals lacked compulsion we would like to see couples develop a plan and then have it as a source of a court order then you know where you stand you know what the minimum access is otherwise you see people make agreements which then fall apart mr parton said he had been told by childrens minister margaret hodge there was not enough time to pass the bill through parliament before the general election which is likely to take place in may the conservatives have called for an equal split between parents on access to be made law theresa may shadow secretary for the family told bbc radio s today programme that the governments plans were inadequate and were papering over the cracks of the current system she said a conservative government would bring a radical reform of the family courts as well as enforcing a legal presumption of coparenting and compulsory mediation we want to make courts the last resort rather than the first resort she added the government says children cannot simply be divided up like property when a marriage collapses the liberal democrats have argued for flexibility in deciding access rules rather than having rigid targets eu referendum could cost m it could cost m to run a uk referendum on the european constitution ministers have revealed in a written parliamentary answer constitutional affairs minister chris leslie said the poll was likely to cost the same as a general election mr leslie said the cost could not be compared with the only previous british referendum held years ago ministers say the constitution would make the european union work better but critics fear creating a super state labour mp john cryer whose question revealed the price estimate said the cost surprised him but was not a central factor as it was important people had their say but he said it would have been better to have rejected the constitution so avoiding the need for a referendum the election cost m no date for the vote has been set but foreign secretary jack straw has suggested it is unlikely to be held until early after the predicted date for the next election most voters said the uk should stay in the common market in the referendum no uk apology for colonial past the days of britain having to apologise for its colonial past are over gordon brown has said the chancellor speaking during a weeklong tour of africa said it was time to talk about enduring british values of liberty and tolerance mr brown has signed a debt relief deal with tanzania which could cost the uk billion south african president thabo mbeki has attacked british imperialists saying they treated africans like savages mr brown said that missionairies had come to africa because of their sense of duty he added that the history of internationalism and enterprise had given britain a greater global reach than any other country bbc political correspondent mark mardell said britishness had long been a theme of the chancellors but never before has he been so outspoken in defending britains past history the uk has pledged to pay of the developing worlds foreign debt bill in an attempt to fight poverty on top of the relief deal with tanzania mr brown said the uk would make similar offers to poorer nations around the world under the plan which could cost the uk bn countries must spend the cash saved on health education and welfare we make this offer unilaterally but we are now asking other countries to join us the chancellor said mr brown on a weeklong tour of africa spent two days in tanzania before heading on friday evening to mozambique a country where more than half of the million population lives below the poverty line there he is expected to strike a similar debt relief pact the chancellor said he hoped other g and european countries would follow suit the uk has already cancelled its bilateral debts money the uk alone is owed with the worlds poorest nations including tanzania former international development secretary clare short questioned the effectiveness of debt relief as a means of tackling poverty blair ready to call election tony blair seems certain to end weeks of phoney war on monday and announce there will be a general election on may the date has been pencilled into the diaries of politicians and political journalists for many months and despite occasional panics that the prime minister was on the verge of calling a snap poll it has not shifted over the weeks there have been any number of signs that was going to be the day mr blair would go for an historic third term and the calling of a special political cabinet meeting has only added to the belief that the announcement is imminent the prime minister and his campaign boss alan milburn have already insisted the election will be fought on the economy and what they claim is a stark choice between labours stability and investment against tory cuts and boom and bust and chancellor gordon brown has stepped into the front line of the campaign to the relief of many of his supporters in westminster to underline that economic message and it is certain one of the big arguments at the centre of the election battle will be around the big parties tax and spend policies during the phoney campaign labour got into trouble over its central claim that michael howard was planning bn cuts in public services the prime minister found himself struggling to explain how a smaller slower increase in spending planned by the tories compared to labours plans was a cut and it looked like the labour campaign which was already being criticised for being thrown into defensive mode by mr howard on issues such as immigration and health was on the rocks then deputy conservative chairman howard flight was reported to have suggested mr howard was secretly planning even bigger cuts he was sacked for his gaffe but the damage had been done and the faltering labour campaign was back on track a second central argument will be over taxation with the tories claiming the chancellor has to fill a black hole at the centre of his finances and will be forced to raise taxes if labour wins again mr brown slaps that aside claiming his forecasts are accurate and that previous claims of looming economic disaster have proved inaccurate as usual the liberal democrats will have to fight to get their voice heard over the sounds of battle between the two big parties but leader charles kennedy believes he has set out a distinctive manifesto with plans for a tax rise for the wealthiest to finance extra spending and the abolition of the council tax in favour of a local income tax other issues are certain to play a part immigration and asylum the war on iraq law and order and education for example but as ever it will be the economy that will almost certainly decide the outcome and whatever that outcome is set to be a far more lively even bitter campaign than s nonevent labour faces cold calls inquiry labour is to be investigated by a watchdog over claims its election campaign has broken the rules on cold calling householders the information commissioner is to look into a complaint from the lib dems about how labour uses its call centres the lib dems say labour is telephoning people who have signed up to make sure they do not get marketing calls labour denies breaking rules it says calls are not marketing if they just ask about peoples voting intentions the party says it would expect the watchdog to take complaints seriously but it has clear legal advice on the issue telephone call centres are expected to be used as never before by all the three major parties in the runup to the general election but seven million telephone numbers are on the telephone preference service tps lists which ban unsolicited sales and marketing calls lib dem chairman matthew taylor has written to the watchdog accusing labour of a flagrant and systematic breach of the laws governing the tps he says the initial call may not be marketing but it identifies voters to whom the party can send promotional material in the future his letter to the commissioner quotes from a labour party handbook about identifying target voters and it quotes a stevenage labour party members newsletter explaining how voters will be telephoned about their voting intentions the voters are put in categories according to their last known voting intention ranging from labour firm to target conservative those who supported the party in the past but this time will be voting tory the newsletter says using the information we know about people we can send them direct mailings for example we could send the target conservative people a letter from someone who had defected from the tories to labour explaining the reasons why voting tory is a bad idea or we could send labour weak people a letter encouraging them to sign up for a postal vote mr taylor tells the commissioner it is clear beyond peradventure from the above that the labour party is engaging in a largescale voter id project for subsequent promotional purposes through targeted and segmented mailings insofar as this project is directed at tps subscribers it is equally clear that it is unlawful the lib dems raised worries about labour and conservative calls in february and people have signed up to the website they set up to help people to complain a party official said there was only scattered evidence of the tories breaking the rules but people had complained every day about labour a spokeswoman for the information commissioners office said it was examining one complaint about political calls understood to be mr taylors we are investigating one of the complaints where some evidence has been given to us she said obviously evidence is needed for us to start investigations the commissioners office will now examine the lib dem evidence the guidance is that cold calling can be made as long as no marketing is going on said the spokeswoman if labour is judged to have broken the rules it will be asked stop immediately if it fails to do so after two or three warning letters the commissioner can issue an enforcement notice spelling out what the party needs to do or stop doing the party could appeal against the decision to an information tribunal if the appeal fails and it continues breaking the rules it could be fined up to labour says it avoids those on tps lists when telephoning people about membership or fundraising but not when making voter identification calls asked about the commissioners inquiry a labour spokesman told bbc news we expect the information commissioner to take any complaint seriously however we are absolutely clear that we havent broken any rules as the information commissioner himself has said if people are not marketing something if they are asking them which way they are going to vote they are not in breach of the law we always ask everyone we phone up whether they would be happy to be contacted by the labour party again blunkett hints at election call exhome secretary david blunkett has given fresh clues that the general election will be announced on monday he told bbc radio five live im out in my constituency getting ready for what we presume will be an announcement very shortly at the weekend he clarified that he meant he would be in his sheffield seat this weekend not that he expected an election call then tony blair is tipped to ask the queen on monday to dissolve parliament ready for a may poll lib dems predict best ever poll the lib dems are set for their best results in both the general election and the local council polls one of their frontbenchers has predicted local government spokesman ed davey was speaking as the party launched its campaign for the local elections being held in english council areas the flagship pledge is to replace council tax with a local income tax the tories say the lib dems would make people pay more tax and labour says the partys sums do not add up looking to the coming elections which are all expected to be held on may mr davey said we are going to be winning more votes and winning more seats i think we are going to have the best general election results and local election results we have ever had under party leader charles kennedy i couldnt think of a stronger endorsement of a leader tories reject rethink on axed mp sacked mp howard flights local conservative association has insisted he will not be its candidate at the general election russell tanguay agent for arundel and south downs tories said mr flight was ineligible to be a candidate and the association was seeking a substitute the news comes despite mr flights allies saying they had enough support to hold a meeting to discuss his fate mr flight landed in trouble over remarks on tory tax and spending plans he quit as tory deputy chairman after apparently suggesting the tories planned extra spending cuts but he wants to continue as an mp tory headquarters says he cannot stand as a conservative candidate because he is no longer an approved candidate mr tanguay backed that view on tuesday saying howard flight is ineligible to stand as a conservative party candidate the association is in the process of selecting a new candidate but the local tory chairman made similar comments on friday and dissent continues two local councillors who back mr flight met mr tanguay and the local associations chairman in arundel on tuesday afternoon but did not comment as they left the meeting mr flight says he will not stand down as a candidate unless his local party instructs him to do so at an extraordinary general meeting egm the mp who is consulting his lawyers told bbc news they selected me and they if you like dispose of me or keep me mr flights supporters also say they have the signatures needed to trigger the egm at a news conference mr howard insisted he had played by the partys rules the tory leader who argues he is ensuring honesty said we do not say one thing in private and another thing in public labour election campaign coordinator alan milburn said the tories were in turmoil because mr flight had exposed their hidden plans the comments were not a oneoff he said claiming mr howard and other senior tories were obsessively committed to cutting public spending liberal democrat chairman matthew taylor said whilst i disagree with howard flights views it seems extraordinary to sack somebody for telling the truth it has also emerged mr howard has suspended sloughs constituency conservative association for refusing to deselect its candidate adrian hilton was abandoned after suggesting the signing of the maastricht treaty under john majors government was an act of treason the catholic herald also highlighted articles he wrote about the role of catholicism in the european union mr hilton was chosen to fight the seat after the previous candidate robert oulds was sacked for being pictured with a range of guns and a hunting knife slough conservative association has now been placed on support status and is being run from conservative campaign headquarters says a senior party spokesman mr hilton on tuesday said he was considering taking legal action against his deposal he said the local party had only learned of the final decision on the bbc news website on monday evening there are people at central office who are behaving like little dictators and seemingly people who are ordinary members are being treated with contempt he said the party says it did try to contact the local conservative chairman expm lord callaghan dies aged former labour prime minister lord callaghan has died on the eve of his rd birthday he passed away at home in east sussex just days after his wife audrey died aged lord callaghan who leaves a son and two daughters was the longest living former british pm in history he entered downing street in after the resignation of harold wilson prime minister tony blair called him a giant of the labour movement he held each of the major offices of chancellor home secretary foreign secretary and prime minister during his career and became lord callaghan of cardiff in chancellor gordon brown said the former pm would be mourned throughout the world it was a commitment to public service that brought jim callaghan into parliament in and while jim rose to the top he never forgot his roots former cabinet colleague lord hattersley said his first reaction on hearing the news was immense sadness it was not a major surprise i knew what a blow the death of his wife audrey was a few days ago he said he was a decent kindly man who helped me and my generation of politicians immensely the labour party and the country will be poorer without him conservative peer lord heseltine said that despite their political differences he and lord callaghan became friends you dont get to the premiership unless you have a streak of determination he said but i saw the other side of jim callaghan he became a personal friend in a way and my family and i were very fond of him tory leader michael howard said he would be remembered with affection and respect liberal democrat leader charles kennedy said when i was first elected in as the youngest mp he was the father of the house and as such took a very keen interest in my early days in parliament he was always full of warmth and wisdom born in and educated at portsmouth northern secondary school lord callaghan became a clerk at the inland revenue he enlisted in the royal navy in and rose to the rank of lieutenant elected for a cardiff constituency at the general election he represented cardiff seats for more than years after serving as a junior minister in the attlee government he became chancellor of the exchequer when labour returned to power in with sterling under pressure he resisted devaluation for three years before being forced into it in his political career was not without controversy when he refused to support prime minister harold wilson and dame barbara castle over the latters trade union manifesto in place of strife in he said i am not going to resign they will have to throw me out when home secretary he ordered british troops to march into the streets of belfast to protect catholic civilians amid rising violence a decision that has dominated british politics into the st century as foreign secretary in the early s lord callaghan kept an open mind about the uks entry into the common market seeing the advantages of the uks entry he once travelled to idi amins uganda in to plead for the life of a british lecturer dennis hills who was under a death sentence for treason his political life was often tempered by battles against the hard left of the party in the autumn of before the winter of discontent when trade unions carried out strikes that brought the country to a standstill lord callaghan refused to hold an early election which may have delivered a labour victory as garbage lay uncollected in the streets and hospital staff council workers and even gravediggers stayed off work lord callaghan failed to predict the mood of the country when britain went to the polls in tory leader margaret thatcher was swept into power in a landslide victory and lord callaghan resigned as labour leader blair prepares to name poll date tony blair is likely to name may as election day when parliament returns from its easter break the bbcs political editor has learned andrew marr says mr blair will ask the queen on or april to dissolve parliament at the end of that week mr blair has so far resisted calls for him to name the day but all parties have stepped up campaigning recently downing street would not be drawn on the claim saying election timing was a matter for the prime minister a number spokeswoman would only say he will announce an election when he wants to announce an election the move will signal a frantic week at westminster as the government is likely to try to get key legislation through parliament the government needs its finance bill covering the budget plans to be passed before the commons closes for business at the end of the session on april but it will also seek to push through its serious and organised crime bill and id cards bill mr marr said on wednesdays today programme theres almost nobody at a senior level inside the government or in parliament itself who doesnt expect the election to be called on or april as soon as the commons is back after the short easter recess tony blair whips up to the palace asks the queen to dissolve parliament and were going the labour government officially has until june to hold general election but in recent years governments have favoured fouryear terms browns poll campaign move denied the government has denied reports that gordon brown is preparing to oust alan milburn as labours election supremo work and pensions minister alan johnson said it was wrong to suggest the chancellor would usurp mr milburn adding they would work as a team a report in the sunday business claimed mr brown has been asked to take charge of media strategy while mr milburn would move to a behindthescenes role labour has always maintained mr brown would have a central campaign role but many labour backbenchers are said to be dissatisfied with the way election campaigning has gone and have said they wanted to see the chancellor take a bigger role some commentators say the tories have grasped the initiative putting labour on the back foot having to respond to conservative policy announcements these claims follow various opinion polls which suggest the tories have been gaining on labour party strategists are believed to want to bring mr brown to centrestage having seen support rise in private polling after his budget last week but another report in the sunday telegraph claims mr milburn is unwilling to allow any new role for the chancellor to come at his expense mr johnson told bbc news gordon brown will play a central role in any election campaign they were wrong when they said milburn was ousting brown and theyre wrong now if they are saying brown is ousting milburn we work as a team mr milburn has repeatedly said the chancellor was key to the campaign and dismissed claims of a rift neither downing street nor the labour party would comment directly on the reports voters dont trust politicians eight out of voters do not trust politicians to tell the truth a new poll conducted for the bbc suggests and of the adults quizzed by icm for bbc news said politicians did not deliver what they promised the poll comes after foreign secretary jack straw predicted trust would be the key choice at the next election both the tories and the lib dems are keen to emphasise a perceived lack of trust in tony blair following his claims over iraqi weapons but according to the bbc poll said the issue of trust made no difference to whether or not they would vote at the next election widely expected on may the poll also looked at what lay behind the lack of trust in politicians some said politicians did not keep the promises they made before elections while said they never gave a straight answer just under threequarters of respondents said politicians had shown themselves to be dishonest too often mr straw told activists in blackburn on thursday that voters would have to decide at the next election which party best deserves their future trust that in the end is the key choice at the next election he acknowledged that the public had lost faith in labour but suggested it could persuade people to reinvest their trust with us if the party could overcome tory attempts to spread cynicism in politics the conservatives are keen to highlight the trust issue during his response to gordon browns budget statement on tuesday michael howard compared the chancellors figures to the prime ministers claims about iraqs weapons of mass destruction the lib dems are also keen to highlight the trust issue with charles kennedy has claiming voters had a fundamental lack of trust in the prime minister and the green party unveiled a billboard opposite the palace of westminster accusing the government of lying over the iraq war former education secretary estelle morris told bbc news that there was a real problem of trust between the public and the politicians she said she did not feel her own colleagues could be trusted but suggested the threecornered relationship between the press politicians and the public had a hand in the issue the public was often turned off by sitting on the sidelines in the battle of words between the politician and the journalist she added lib dem foreign affairs spokesman menzies campbell said the iraq war had hit trust in politicians hard issues of war and peace life and death do have a very damaging effect on the credibility of politicians martin bell who won the tatton seat from tory neil hamilton on anticorruption platform said politicians often failed to see themselves as others did we need public figures we trust to tell the truth and who can see themselves as others see them tory candidate quits over remark a conservative election challenger is quitting after being quoted as wanting a period of creative destruction in the public services danny kruger who also works in the tory research unit had been due to take on tony blair in sedgefield he says his remark last week was misrepresented but he will not contest the election for fear of damaging the conservative cause tory leader michael howard accepted his decision with regret mr kruger was quoted in the guardian newspaper saying we plan to introduce a period of creative destruction in the public services in a statement the party said the comment had been taken out of context he fully supports the partys policies on and approach to the public services said the statement however in order to avoid any further misrepresentation of his views and any damage to the party he has decided not to stand in the sedgefield constituency at the next election mr kruger is continuing in his job at the tory campaign headquarters labour election coordinator alan milburn claimed mr kruger had exposed the tory agenda for bn of cuts to public services mr milburn said he is not some unknown hopeful fighting an unwinnable seat he is a man who has worked at the heart of conservative policy development his claim that the tories were planning a period of creative destruction in the public services is not a rogue claim it is the authentic and shocking voice of the conservative party it reveals the true picture of what they would do abortion not a poll issue blair tony blair does not believe abortion should be an election issue arguing it is a matter for individual conscience the prime ministers spokesman set out mr blairs view after the top catholic in england and wales backed michael howards stance on abortions the tory leader supports a reduction in the legal limit from weeks to and has said current rules are tantamount to abortion on demand the prime minister has made it clear he has no plans to the change the law mr blairs spokesman said the catholic church has a wellknown position on this issue and it was one of many issues the cardinal mentioned and therefore it should be seen in that context his words came as cardinal cormac murphy oconnor the archbishop of westminster backed mr howards stance and distanced himself from labour in a statement he said abortion was a very key issue saying the policy supported by mr howard is one that we would commend on the way to a full abandonment of abortion cardinal oconnor claimed labour had developed the notion that it was the natural party of catholics but he said we are not going to suggest people support one particular party the family planning association says a reduction would particularly affect young women who often seek help later more than women in england and wales had terminations last year of which fewer than were carried out between and weeks in the cosmopolitan interview mr howard said i believe abortion should be available to everyone but the law should be changed in the past i voted for a restriction to weeks and i would be prepared to go down to all three main parties say the issue is one for each mps conscience rather than one where there is a partywide policy mr howard stressed his views were his personal views shadow home secretary david davis said he understood mr howard had been signalling that a conservative government would allow a commons vote on the issue mr blair and liberal democrat leader charles kennedy also gave their views during interviews conducted as part of the magazines high heeled vote campaign mr blair who last year denied he planned to join his wife and four children in the catholic faith despite regularly taking communion said abortion was a difficult issue however much i dislike the idea of abortion you should not criminalise a woman who in very difficult circumstances makes that choice obviously there is a time beyond which you cant have an abortion and we have no plans to change that although the debate will continue mr kennedy said he had previously voted for a week limit but medical advances mean i dont know what i would do now the roman catholic archbishop of cardiff the most reverend peter smith told bbc radio s today programme that the church merely wanted people to reflect on issues in light of the gospel before voting anne weyman chief executive of the family planning association asked what is the benefit to women or to the potential child of forcing a woman to have a baby antiabortion group the prolife alliance congratulated mr howard on his new stance but said it did not go far enough profile gordon brown the ultimate prize of downing street may continue to elude him but as he prepares to deliver a recordbreaking ninth budget gordon brown can at least console himself with the thought that he is the longest serving chancellor of modern times he reached that milestone last june when he overtook david lloyd george who served for seven years and days between and how much longer mr brown will continue in the job is not clear he once said there are two types of chancellor those who fail and those who get out in time there are rumours he will be moved to the foreign office if labour wins the general election but for now mr brown dominates the domestic political scene like few chancellors or politicians before him gordon brown was born in glasgow on february the son of a church of scotland minister in the small fife town of kirkcaldy at he was canvassing for labour and by his s he was a leading political activist in scotland he achieved a first class degree in history from edinburgh university where he went on to complete a phd his early career was spent lecturing working in television and making a name for himself in the scottish labour party his first attempt to enter westminster for edinburgh south in was thwarted by the present tory spokesman on foreign affairs michael ancram but in he took dunfermline east a new constituency including rosyth naval base pit villages and coastal towns entering westminster he came to share an office with the newly elected mp for sedgefield tony blair within four years mr brown had gained his first frontbench post as shadow chief secretary to the treasury he became shadow chancellor under john smiths leadership in after the death of leader john smith in he stood aside agreeing to give tony blair a clear run at the leadership during a now infamous meal at the granita restaurant in islington the other part of the deal that mr blair will one day stand down in favour of the chancellor is the stuff of westminster legend mr blairs supporters say such a deal never existed and endless newspaper columns and even a television film have been devoted to the alleged deal but if his leadership ambitions were at least temporarily thwarted in mr brown continued his devotion to politics during the election campaign he is said to have worked an average of hours a day six days a week after running on a treadmill for an hour each morning this dedication to his career was underlined by a comment by mr browns former girlfriend of five years princess marguerite of romania the eldest daughter of exking michael of romania who said a relationship with him was politics politics politics if that was true then mr brown who married pr executive sarah macaulay in changed his perspective when the couple were hit by tragedy early in their daughter jennifer died in edinburgh royal infirmary days after being born seven weeks prematurely a year later in october the couple had a son john an event which again gave the chancellor an opportunity to show his softer side a trip to africa earlier this year to publicise his scheme to cancel the debt of poor nations also gave the chancellor an opportunity to show his more human side the ideological differences between mr brown and mr blair remain relatively modest the chancellor opposes the further encroachment of the market into the nhs and is seen as being more old labour than mr blair in his approach to wealth redistribution but their shared belief that market economics are compatible with social justice continues to form the ideological heart of the new labour project yet they are portrayed by the media as being locked in almost permanent conflict with mr brown supposedly nursing resentment at being betrayed by his younger downing street neighbour over the succession mr blair for his part is said to be frustrated that his public service reforms are being thwarted by a vengeful mr brown who reportedly delights in keeping the prime minister in the dark over the contents of his budget until the last possible minute after a recent run of negative headlines labour mps took the unprecedented step of making a direct appeal to the two men stop bickering for the good of the party events like this and the testimony of former ministerial colleagues make it impossible to dismiss the brownblair feud as just journalistic hearsay cooked up by hacks and camp followers in the hothouse atmosphere of westminster how much it damages the ability of government to do its job is open to question a truce appears to have been called in the run up to the general election after a fresh spat was sparked by blairite alan milburn being brought in over the head of mr brown to run the election campaign but with the tories having appeared to get the better of the preelection campaign thus far there are reports that mr brown using the budget as a springboard is to revitalise labours campaign amid all this it is easy to forget that mr brown remains the man most likely to succeed mr blair as labour leader there may be no shortage of possible contenders for the crown including mr milburn but none can command the sort of support in the parliamentary party and beyond that mr brown can and mr blairs decision to name his own retirement date has at least given mr brown something to aim for even if the prime ministers intention to serve a full third term if elected took the shine off the announcement for the chancellor and his supporters boateng to step down at election paul boateng chief secretary to the treasury is to step down as a labour mp at the forthcoming general election mr boateng is to become the uks high commissioner to south africa he was the uks first black cabinet minister when appointed to his post in promoted from the home office where he had been prisons minister mr boateng served on the greater london council before being elected to parliament in declaring today brent south tomorrow soweto he will succeed the previous high commissioner ann grant shortly after the next election which is widely expected to be held on may the appointment is dependent on labours reelection prime minister tony blair said paul has been both a valued colleague and a trusted friend for many years he has made an immense contribution to public life in britain and i am delighted that he has agreed to continue that service to the people of britain by acting as their representative in south africa chancellor gordon brown said over the past eight years pauls contribution to the treasury and the government has been exceptional and it has been my privilege to have worked closely with him closely at the treasury i congratulate paul on his new appointment he has displayed huge dedication to the cause of african development for many years and it is fitting that in this year of challenge and opportunity for the african continent paul has been given such a pivotal role in our fight against poverty and injustice i look forward to continuing to work with paul on this vital agenda mr boateng said i am honoured to be asked to take on this role especially as it comes at such an integral time for our relationship with south africa and the african continent there shall be many new challenges and opportunities ahead and i look forward to embracing them with great anticipation asked if he was appointed as the result of a fair and open competition he replied i have been appointed as a result of a process thats been used before by labour and conservative governments to appoint people of all parties who have relevant experience mr boateng also laughed off suggestions that his reelection in brent south seat had been in danger saying it was one of the safest labour seats in the country shadow foreign secretary michael ancram said that if in government he would refuse to approve either mr boatengs appointment or that of excabinet minister helen liddell as high commissioner to australia mr blairs appointment of paul boateng is the latest example of a worrying trend of failed tonys cronies being appointed to senior diplomatic posts he said tories urge change at the top tory delegates are gathering for what is expected to be their last conference before the general election declaring britain needs a change at the top the party goes into its spring forum trying to highlight what it sees as a clear choice between it and labour tory cochairman liam fox has opened proceedings with a speech criticising tony blairs record in government labours rule has been characterised by lost trust and failure to deliver he told the brighton conference he also attacked the governments failure to control immigration and asylum and criticised its record on the nhs telling delegates labour cannot be trusted on education or crime a tory government would sort out the shambles of immigration put patients before statistics and bring discipline to schools he said dr fox also underlined tory promises to cut tax by bn bbc political correspondent shaun ley says opinion polls suggest the tories still lag some way behind labour on the issues of health education and the economy conservative leader michael howard who had been due to welcome delegates to the conference on friday will address them in a lunchtime speech his welcome address had to be postponed after he stayed in london to lead the partys opposition to the prevention of terrorism bill in its lengthy progress through parliament the bill was finally passed on friday evening after more than hours of debate mr howard is likely to defend his partys handling of the bill which was only passed after the conservatives accepted prime minister tony blairs promise that mps would be able to review it within a year howards unfinished business hes not finished yet whispered the conservative party person as your reporter attempted to slip quietly from the hall and indeed he wasnt michael howard had already broken away from the printed text of his speech at his partys spring conference in brighton to deliver a smart rebuff to peter hains description of him as an attack mongrel claiming such personal abuse meant labour was rattled by the tory challenge and here he was again moving to the front of the stage as the party faithful rose to their feet in applause to make a personal adlibbed appeal to them to go out and fight for victory one day you will be able to tell your children and grandchildren as i will tell mine i was there i did my bit i played my part i helped to win that famous election the election that transformed our country for the better the speech which was peppered with references to mr howards humble beginnings as the child of immigrants had been introduced by his son nick a trainee vicar who praised his fathers honesty i always know where i am with him because all my life he has meant what he has said to me he said mr howard was also joined on stage by his wife sandra daughter larissa and stepson sholto the audiences reaction to all of this was a little muted by party conference standards but mr howards overall message that the tories have labour on the run and that they can win the next election did not sound quite as hollow as it might have done six months ago mr howard claimed with some justification that the tories campaign has got off to a great start they have had labour on the back foot over immigration with tony blair hastily adding a sixth promise on the issue to his latest pledge card and have even managed to score points in traditional labour territory such as health and education the stunts involving margaret dixon with her postponed operation and maria hutchings with concerns about her sons special needs education may not have been to everyones taste but they succeeded in bringing the issues alive and forcing labour to react senior tories believe they are at long last starting to tap into the public mood cutting through the background noise to connect with the ordinary voter their latest poster campaign flags up a range of policies from better school discipline cleaner hospitals i mean how hard is it to keep a hospital clean and immigration its not racist to impose limits on immigration under the headline are you thinking what we are thinking this they say contrasts with labours negative campaigning such as its now infamous flying pigs poster oliver letwin one of the men lampooned in the labour poster affects bewilderment at what he believes is labours loss of its once sure footing on the campaign trail the peter hain mongrel attack he says is just the latest example of the party getting the tone wrong a byproduct he claims of the tories setting the agenda i have to say i dont understand what they are doing the labour machine appears to be in some kind of state of shock it doesnt seem to know what to do a few weeks of positive headlines have also done wonders for tory activists morale likely to be a crucial factor at an election which most analysts seem to agree will hinge on which party can get their core support out it has been a fantastic few weeks said yearold politics student nick vaughan our policies have been getting in the media and there is a sense that we can win i wouldnt be here if i didnt think we could some delegates even spoke of the next election being like when ted heath behind in the polls and written off by the pundits snatched victory from harold wilsons labour party they all insisted it was not going to be a rerun of we thought in we were going to dent that massive majority but it just didnt happen said john murray of aldridge browhills conservatives it was very disappointing this time it really is different whoever is running our strategy from the top has got it bang on blair is on the back foot much of the credit for the tories recent change of fortune must go to lynton crosby the australian strategist who succeeded in turning political veteran and apparent nohoper john howard of australias liberal party into a serial election winner the tories still have a mountain climb if michael howard is to walk through the doors of number even allowing for the natural bias against the tories in some opinion polls they are still behind when to have a chance of overturning labours whopping majority they should really be ahead but as they gear up for the start of the campaign proper the party at least has reason to hope that like his australian namesake mr howard really isnt finished yet last chance warning for voters people in england scotland and wales must have registered by gmt to be able to vote in the general election if it is held as expected on may those who filled in forms last autumn should already be on the register but those who have moved house or were on holiday may have been left off there will also be elections for local councils and mayors in

stokeontrent are also scheduled for may last week preston city council reported that more than of its voters were not registered its electoral roll fell by in a year the biggest dip in the uk an electoral commission spokeswoman said political decisions are made on your behalf every day but only by using your right to vote at an election can you really have a say on the issues you care about if you want your voice to be heard on may you will need to have registered by friday march council tax payers are not eligible to vote without registration officials have stressed sainsburys labour election gift science minister lord sainsbury has made a m donation to the labour party for its general election fund it is the latest hefty donation to the party by the billionaire he has contributed more than m since david sainsbury said he was pleased to give cash to a party that had the vision to deliver economic prosperity and better public services for britain general secretary matt carter said it was a fantastic gift that would help labour fight and win the election through the generosity of david sainsbury and other labour supporters labour will be campaigning hard to take britain forward and to stop the tories taking us back mr carter said lord sainsbury added i am pleased to be able to make this contribution to the general election funds of the labour party because i believe that they are the only party that has the vision to deliver both economic prosperity and better public services for britain the yearold latest donation follows a m gift to the party in lord sainsbury was created a life peer in a year before he was appointed as minister for science blair up for it ahead of poll tony blair says his personal standing in the eyes of voters will be an issue in the general election the prime minister said he was up for it as the country waits to go to the polls possibly in a matter of weeks he told the observer government life was a constant barrage of attack but said he would not stay in charge if he felt unable to contribute mr blair also spoke of meeting many people across the country with concerns about the compensation culture he said britain was in danger of needless panic over public safety issues speaking amid a flurry of preelection campaigning the prime minister said i am an issue i always will be whoever is the prime minister will be he added if you are afraid to take criticism you should go and do another job asked if he would quit as leader if he felt like a liability to labour he said its important always not to do the job unless you feel you have something to contribute whether he still had something to offer he said was a judgement for people to make mr blairs assessment is likely to be seen as a signal that replacing him would not bring an upsurge in fortunes for the labour administration his comments come as the cochairman of the conservative party liam fox on saturday called him a disappointment of historic proportions as a prime minister mr blair said he had learned from a series of at times tough encounters with members of the public during question and answer sessions across the country in recent weeks he pledged to clamp down on britains growing compensation culture which has brought concerns that doctors teachers and other professionals are being hampered in their work by the fear of frivolous lawsuits i was quite shocked to be told by people who were running a nursery that they were worried about letting the kids out into the playground when it was wet in case one of them slipped and fell and they ended up having a legal case against them he said we have got to look at a way of getting people protection on that mr blair said the government was also looking at how to make sure that legal aid is not abused with actions against doctors and others as part of a review being carried out by the lord chancellors department and there should be real debate about the risk posed by public safety threats he said we are in danger of depending on whatever is the media campaign of the day ending up spending literally hundreds sometimes millions of pounds meeting quite a small risk his comments come after the government announced it is to spend m on drugs to treat a possible outbreak of bird flu and the sudan food scare meanwhile commons leader peter hain has warned that on the campaign trail he has seen dangerous complacency being displayed by labour voters convinced of a general election victory if labour voters stayed at home in marginal seats they could see tory leader michael howard coming in the back door to number with the tradesmans key to number getting into power he added labour mp praises tory campaign the conservatives have been a lot smarter in the way they have conducted the general election campaign a labour backbencher has said derek wyatt said having a five month campaign turned off voters and suggested people were already rather bored of the thing he wants a greater campaigning role for chancellor gordon brown labour said the economy was at the heart of the campaign and mr brown therefore had a prominent role but mr wyatt argued by some way he is currently the figure in all of the polls that people trust and see that has delivered over eight years an economy unmatched anywhere in the world so it would be a tad foolish of the labour party if we did not use him as we have done over the past three elections labours election chief alan milburn denied there was an attempt to sideline mr brown after facing criticism for letting the tories set the agenda however mr wyatt predicted the campaign would get under way properly once the chancellor delivered his budget the mp for sittingbourne and sheppey said prime minister tony blair had been trying very hard to improve his own standing with the electorate through a sort of campaign of trust but mr blair had been hurt by the iraq controversy he added a labour party spokesman played down differences with mr wyatt and said mr brown already had a prominent campaign role this election is a choice between labour taking britain forward and the conservatives taking us back top tories on lib dem hit list the liberal democrats are aiming to unseat a string of top tories including leader michael howard at the next general election mr howards seat is at the top of the liberal democrats list others targeted include oliver letwin david davis and theresa may lib dems elections chief lord rennard said he said it was nothing personal but that very many of the prominent conservatives had slender leads in seats where the lib dems were second in michael howard won the folkestone hythe seat with votes compared to for the liberal democrat candidate peter carroll giving the tory leader a majority of asked if this amounted to the partys much vaunted decapitation strategy lord rennard said it was not a term he had ever used but he urged labour supporters to vote tactically to remove prominent conservatives i just dont think labour voters in these sort of seats could resist the temptation to use their votes effectively to remove a conservative he denied this strategy was opportunism insisting the lib dems policies on issues such as tuition fees the council tax and free care for the elderly appealed to all sides of the political spectrum we are in favour of tactical voting as long as the tactic is to vote liberal democrat he added a conservative spokesperson said the liberal democrats can talk all they like about strategy the problem the liberal democrats face is that a large number of lib dem voters do not agree with their policies we will be pointing out how they are soft on crime how they support higher taxes their opposition to controlled immigration and support for giving europe more control over our lives lib dems unveil election slogan the liberal democrats will present themselves as the real alternative in the forthcoming general election campaign charles kennedy has said unveiling the slogan at the partys spring conference he said there was no glass ceiling to its ambitions he told delegates that labour had abused the publics trust and that the tories had failed to oppose them in response the conservatives insisted that theirs was the party that understood the forgotten majority speaking in harrogate mr kennedy said people want a credible principled political party which offers a different vision of what britain can be only the liberal democrats stood against the iraq war he said and they had also provided strong opposition to the governments plans on id cards antiterror measures and taxation he said if you voted conservative in what good did it do you your vote was wasted what people needed was a party which was listening to their concerns a party which was prepared to stand up and say so a party which said no to the prime minister responding to the claims tory party cochairman liam fox said like labour the lib dems are soft on crime support higher taxes oppose controlled immigration and support giving europe more control over our lives mr kennedy also outlined his partys plan to impose a income tax rate on earnings over a year the money would be used to help pay for key policies such as abolishing university tuition fees scrapping council tax in favour of local income tax and providing free care for the elderly he said labour and the tories claim the sums do not add up and that working families would be hardest hit mr kennedy said britain is the fourthlargest economy in the world we have world class businesses and a world class workforce so why are two million of our pensioners living below the poverty line all the parties are campaigning hard for an expected election in may although prime minister tony blair has not confirmed any timing earlier mr kennedy told radio s today programme there was no possibility of forming a coalition with labour in the event of a hung parliament we go into the election as an independent party and we come out as an independent party he said mr kennedy has been under fire in recent days for missing mondays commons vote on the governments controversial antiterrorism laws along with other lib dem mps on saturday the lib dem chief executive said it was just a cockup that mr kennedy and his colleagues missed the vote which the government won by a majority of only nobody had any idea that was going to happen lord rennard told reporters at the party conference he said he was certain mps would get another chance to vote against the plans
