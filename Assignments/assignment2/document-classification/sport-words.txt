claxton hunting first major medal british hurdler sarah claxton is confident she can win her first major medal at next months european indoor championships in madrid the yearold has already smashed the british record over m hurdles twice this season setting a new mark of seconds to win the aaas title i am quite confident said claxton but i take each race as it comes as long as i keep up my training but not do too much i think there is a chance of a medal claxton has won the national m hurdles title for the past three years but has struggled to translate her domestic success to the international stage now the scotlandborn athlete owns the equal fifthfastest time in the world this year and at last weeks birmingham grand prix claxton left european medal favourite russian irina shevchenko trailing in sixth spot for the first time claxton has only been preparing for a campaign over the hurdles which could explain her leap in form in previous seasons the yearold also contested the long jump but since moving from colchester to london she has refocused her attentions claxton will see if her new training regime pays dividends at the european indoors which take place on march osullivan could run in worlds sonia osullivan has indicated that she would like to participate in next months world cross country championships in st etienne athletics ireland have hinted that the yearold cobh runner may be included in the official lineup for the event in france on march provincial teams were selected after last saturdays nationals in santry and will be officially announced this week osullivan is at present preparing for the london marathon on april the participation of osullivan currentily training at her base in australia would boost the ireland team who won the bronze three years agio the first three at santry last saturday jolene byrne maria mccambridge and fionnualla britton are automatic selections and will most likely form part of the longcourse team osullivan will also take part in the bupa great ireland run on april in dublin greene sets sights on world title maurice greene aims to wipe out the pain of losing his olympic m title in athens by winning a fourth world championship crown this summer he had to settle for bronze in greece behind fellow american justin gatlin and francis obikwelu of portugal it really hurts to look at that medal it was my mistake i lost because of the things i did said greene who races in birmingham on friday its never going to happen again my goal im going to win the worlds greene crossed the line just seconds behind gatlin who won in seconds in one of the closest and fastest sprints of all time but greene believes he lost the race and his title in the semifinals in my semifinal race i should have won the race but i was conserving energy thats when francis obikwelu came up and i took third because i didnt know he was there i believe thats what put me in lane seven in the final and while i was in lane seven i couldnt feel anything in the race i just felt like i was running all alone i believe if i was in the middle of the race i would have been able to react to people that came ahead of me greene was also denied olympic gold in the xm mens relay when he could not catch britains mark lewisfrancis on the final leg the kansas star is set to go headtohead with lewisfrancis again at fridays norwich union grand prix the pair contest the m the distance over which greene currently holds the world record of seconds he then has another indoor meeting in france before resuming training for the outdoor season and the task of recapturing his world title in helsinki in august greene believes gatlin will again prove the biggest threat to his ambitions in finland but he also admits he faces more than one rival for the world crown theres always someone else coming i think when i was coming up i would say there was me and ato boldon in the young crowd greene said now youve got about five or six young guys coming up at the same time osullivan commits to dublin race sonia osullivan will seek to regain her title at the bupa great ireland run on april in dublin the yearold was beaten into fourth at last years event having won it a year earlier i understand shes had a solid winters training down in australia after recovering from a minor injury said race director matthew turnbull mark carroll irish record holder at km km and km will make his debut in the mass participation km race carroll has stepped up his form in recent weeks and in late january scored an impressive m victory over leading american alan webb in boston carroll will be facing stiff competition from australian craig mottram winner in dublin for the last two years hansen delays return until british triple jumper ashia hansen has ruled out a comeback this year after a setback in her recovery from a bad knee injury according to reports hansen the commonwealth and european champion has been sidelined since the european cup in poland in june it was hoped she would be able to return this summer but the wound from the injury has been very slow to heal her coach aston moore told the times were not looking at any sooner than not as a triple jumper moore said hansen may be able to return to sprinting and long jumping sooner but there is no shortterm prospect of her being involved again in her specialist event there was a problem with the wound healing and it set back her rehabilitation by about two months but that has been solved and we can push ahead now he said the aim is for her to get fit as an athlete then we will start looking at sprinting and the long jump as an introduction back to the competitive arena moore said he is confident hansen can make it back to toplevel competition though it is unclear if that will be in time for the commonwealth games in melbourne next march when she will be its been a frustrating time for her but it has not fazed her determination he added collins to compete in birmingham world and commonwealth m champion kim collins will compete in the m at the norwich union grand prix in birmingham on february the st kitts and nevis star joins british olympic

lewisfrancis are olympic gold medallists now and im sure theyll be aiming to win in front of their home supporters im looking forward to competing against britains best sprinters and im sure the metres will be one of the most exciting races of the evening collins was sixth in the olympic final in athens but is hoping for a better result at the world championships in finland this summer this will be a big year for me and i plan to defend my m world title in helsinki in august before then i want to perform well over m indoors and start my year in winning form radcliffe yet to answer gb call paula radcliffe has been granted extra time to decide whether to compete in the world crosscountry championships the yearold is concerned the event which starts on march in france could upset her preparations for the london marathon on april there is no question that paula would be a huge asset to the gb team said zara hyde peters of uk athletics but she is working out whether she can accommodate the worlds without too much compromise in her marathon training radcliffe must make a decision by tuesday the deadline for team nominations british team member hayley yelling said the team would understand if radcliffe opted out of the event it would be fantastic to have paula in the team said the european crosscountry champion but you have to remember that athletics is basically an individual sport and anything achieved for the team is a bonus she is not messing us around we all understand the problem radcliffe was world crosscountry champion in and but missed last years event because of injury in her absence the gb team won bronze in brussels edwards tips idowu for euro gold world outdoor triple jump record holder and bbc pundit jonathan edwards believes phillips idowu can take gold at the european indoor championships idowu landed m at the british trials in sheffield last month to lead the world triple jump rankings its all down to him but if he jumps as well as he did in sheffield he could win the gold medal said edwards his ability is undoubted but all his best performances seem to happen in domestic meetings idowu made his breakthrough five years ago but so far has only a commonwealth silver medal to his name edwards himself kept idowu off top spot at the manchester games but he believes the european indoors in madrid represent a chance for the yearold to prove his credentials as britains top triple jumper he has to start producing at international level and here is the beginning said edwards phillips still needs to be much more consistent im sure a victory in madrid will build up his confidence and selfbelief that he can be best in the world the qualifying round of the mens triple jump in madrid takes place on friday with the final scheduled for saturday olympic champion christian olsson will not be taking part as he is out for the entire indoor season with an ankle injury kenya lift chepkemeis suspension kenyas athletics body has reversed a ban on marathon runner susan chepkemei after she made an official apology athletics kenya ak had suspended the twotime london marathon runnerup for failing to turn up to a crosscountry team training camp in embu we have withdrawn the ban chepkemei has given a reason for her absence said ak chief isaiah kiplagat she explained she had a contract with the organisers of the race in puerto rice and we have accepted her apology the kenyan coaching team will now decide whether chepkemei can be included in the team for this months world cross country championships the yearold would be a strong contender at the event in france and is hopeful she will be granted a place in the strong squad i am satisfied that the whole saga has been brought to an end chepkemei said i am ready and prepared to represent my country i will be disappointed if i am not given a chance to compete at the world cross country championships ak had insisted it was making an example of chepkemei by banning her from competition until the end of but the organisation came under intense international and domestic pressure to reverse its decision the yearold took part in the and london marathons and was edged out by radcliffe in an epic new york marathon contest last year the twotime world halfmarathon silver medallist will be back to challenge radcliffe at this years london event in april ak also dropped its harsh stance on threetime world cross country km champion edith masai masai missed kenyas world cross country trials because of an ankle problem but ak insisted it would take disciplinary action unless she could prove she was really injured subject to our doctors confirmation we have decided to clear masai added kiplagat mcilroy aiming for madrid title northern ireland man james mcilroy is confident he can win his first major title at this weekends spar european indoor championships in madrid the yearold has been in great form in recent weeks and will go in as one of the metres favourites i believe after my wins abroad and in our trial race in sheffield i can run my race from the front back or middle said mcilroy new coach tony lester has helped get mcilroys career back on track the yearold metres runner has not always matched his promise with performances but believes his decision to change coaches and move base will bring the rewards mcilroy now lives in windsor and feels his career has been transformed by the nononsense leadership style of former army sergeant lester lester is better known for his work with m runners roger black and mark richardson in the past but under his guidance mcilroy has secured five wins this indoor season mcilroy now claims he is in his best shape since finishing fourth for ireland at the outdoor european championships in that was my last decent year said mcilroy who temporarily retired last august before returning to the sport under lesters shrewd guidance before every race was like trying to climb mount everest and i now know you cant do it on your own trying to succeed saw me sometimes standing halfdead and terrified on the starting line which became a bit too much mcilroy who was compared to the likes of sebastian coe steve cram and steve ovett in his younger days is now competing without the benefit of national lottery funding that situation could change if he maintains his current form and repeats the worldclass times he produced in the m and m at major races in erfurt and stuttgart earlier this season russian dmitriy bogdanov won at the same madrid venue last week and then claimed the european championship race would be between himself dutchman arnoud okken and antonio reina of spain but mcilroy is unfazed he admitted he looked quite good in his win and fair enough everyone has the right to their own opinion i never write myself off and lets face it i havent or looked like being beaten this season and mcilroy whose time of one minute seconds in erfurt elevated him to sixth place on the uk alltime list is also already looking beyond madrid he said ive been much more focused this year about my career and having such a good team around me has been very important ultimately of course this weekend is a means to an end and that is getting prepared for the summers world championships that ambition has meant that ive had only two nights out since last august the rest of my time has seen me just

the pairs sensational withdrawal from the athens games the lawyer added that he has proof the authorities knew kenteris was in germany at the time he was alleged to have missed a test in chicago nick

hit the front just before the bell in front of a sellout crowd in glasgow and cruised to victory in a time of four minutes seconds it was nice to get that out of the way i was nervous about whether i would actually be able to get round i felt good i just had to relax and use my racing knowledge said holmes it was all about winning in front of my home crowd the time is irrelevant i got round in one piece and didnt disgrace myself now its about going forward the reception ive had since the olympics has been amazing and thats why i wanted to keep running this year because i get a buzz from the crowd holmes ran a tactically perfect race to finish clear of frances hind dehiba and russias svetlana cherkasova the olympic m and m champions time was inside the qualifying mark for the european

moments kenteris won m gold at the sydney olympics while thanou won silver in the m they withdrew from the athens games last august after missing drugs tests on the eve of the opening ceremony the

tampering with the doping inspection process all three who have repeatedly denied the allegations have also been charged by a greek prosecutor and face trial for dopingrelated charges a trial date has not been set in imposing twoyear suspensions on the duo on december the iaaf described their explanations for missing the tests as unacceptable but kenteris lawyer gregory ioannidis told bbc sport earlier this week he was confident the sprinters would be cleared of the charges of failing to give information on their location and refusing to submit to testing we refute both charges as unsubstantiated and illogical he said there have been certain breaches in the correct application of the rules on behalf of the sporting authorities and their officials and these procedural breaches have also violated my clients rights there is also evidence that proves the fact that my client has been persecuted chepkemei joins edinburgh lineup susan chepkemei has decided she is fit enough to run in next months great edinburgh international cross country the kenyan was initially unsure if she would have recovered from her gruelling tussle with paula radcliffe in the new york marathon in time to compete but she has declared herself up to the task and joins a field headed by world cross country champion benita johnson race director matthew turnbull said susan will add even more strength in depth to the worldclass line up chepkemei who won the six kilometre event three years ago when it was staged in newcastle endured an epic battle with radcliffe in the big apple until the briton outsprinted her in the final m tirunesh dibaba of ethiopia will defend the title she won last year in tyneside before the race was moved north of the border recentlycrowned european cross country champion briton hayley yelling also competes in edinburgh on january as does inform scot kathy butler el guerrouj targets cross country double olympic champion hicham el guerrouj is set to make a rare appearance at the world cross country championships in france but the moroccan who has not raced over cross country for years will not decide until two weeks before the event which starts on march if i am to compete in it it is only if i feel i can win said the yearold who is retiring in otherwise there is not much point in me going el guerrouj achieved a lifetime ambition last august when he clinched his first olympic titles over m and m but the fourtime world m champion is still hungry for more success before calling time on his career the yearold has set his sights on clinching the world m crown in helsinki this summer and he is aiming to break m olympic champion kenenisa bekeles m and m world records el guerrouj could meet bekele in march as the ethiopian is the defending world cross country champion over both the long and short courses but the moroccan will not commit himself to the st galmier event until he assesses how well his winter training is going the return to training was very difficult because i accepted a lot of invitations these past few months said el guerrouj i am almost a month behind but i am on the right track britains paula radcliffe has also not ruled out competing in the world cross country championships i havent quite decided what events i will compete in prior to london but the world cross country is an event which is also special to me and is a definite possibility said the twotime champion collins appeals against drugs ban sprinter michelle collins has lodged an appeal against her eightyear doping ban with the north american court of arbitration for sport cas the yearold received the ban last month as a result of her connection to the federal inquiry into the balco doping scandal she is the first athlete to be banned without a positive drugs test or an admission of drugs use cas has said that a ruling is normally given within four months of an appeal collins was suspended by the us antidoping agency based on patterns observed in her blood and urine tests as well as evidence in the balco investigation as well as being hit with the ban collins was stripped of her world and us indoor m titles the san franciscobased balco laboratory is at the centre of the scandal which has rocked the sport the company has been accused of distributing illegal performanceenhancing drugs to elite athletes holmes feted with further honour double olympic champion kelly holmes has been voted european athletics eaa woman athlete of in the governing bodys annual poll the briton made a dame in the new year honours list for taking m and m gold won vital votes from the public press and eaa member federations she is only the second british woman to land the title after sally gunnell won for her world m hurdles win in swedish triple jumper christian olsson was voted male athlete of the year the accolade is the latest in a long list of awards that holmes has received since her success in athens in addition to becoming a dame she was also named the bbc sports personality of the year in december her gutsy victory in the m also earned her the international association of athletics federations award for the best womens performance in the world for and she scooped two awards at the british athletics writers association annual dinner in october isinbayeva heads for birmingham olympic pole vault champion yelena isinbayeva has confirmed she will take part in the norwich union grand prix in birmingham on february everybody knows how much i enjoy competing in britain i always seem to break records there said isinbayeva as olympic champion there will be more attention on me this year but hopefully i can respond with another record in birmingham kelly holmes and carolina kluft are among other athens winners competing the organisers are hoping that isinbayevas main rival fellow russian svetlana feofanova will also take part in the event the pair had a thrilling battle in athens which ended with isinbayeva finally jumping a world record of m to claim the gold medal isinbayeva has set world records in the pole vault three of which have come on british soil an irish athletics year wont be remembered as one of irish athletics great years the year began with that optimism which invariably and unaccountably seems to herald an upcoming olympiad but come late august a few hot days in the magnificent stadium in athens told us of the true strength of irish athletics or to be more accurate the lack of it sonia osullivans olympic farewell apart there was little to stir the emotions of irish athletics watchers but after the disastrous buildup to the games we shouldnt have been surprised at the start of the year an osullivan had been earmarked as irelands best medal prospect but as it turned out walker gillian never even made it to the start line because of injury less than a week before the olympics the sport was rocked by news that m hope cathal lombard had tested for the banned substance epo lombards shattering of mark carrolls national m record in april had already set tongues wagging but even the most cynical of observers were surprised when he was rumbled after an irish sports council sting operation the corkman quickly held his hands up in admission and was promptly handed a twoyear ban from the sport back at preolympic ranch in greece it must have seemed that things couldnt have got any worse but they very nearly did with walker jamie costin lucky to escape with his life after being involved in a car crash near athens once the track and field action began in athens a familiar pattern of underachievement emerged although alistair craggs performance in being the only athlete from a european nation to qualify for the m final did offer hope for the future our beloved sonia scraped into the womens k final as a fastest loser and for a couple of days the country attempted to delude itself into believing that she might be in the medal shakeup as it happened she went out the back door early in the final although there was nothing undignified about the way that she insisted on finishing the race over a minute behind winner meseret defar it later transpired that sonia had been suffering from a stomach bug in the hours before the final although typically the cobhwoman played down the effects of the illness amazingly she was back in action a couple of weeks later when beating a worldclass field at the flora lite k road race in london and while her major championship days may be over its unlikely that we have seen the last of her in competition at least sonia managed to make it to athens at the start of the year several northern ireland athletes had genuine hopes of qualifying for the games but come august an outofform and injured paul brizzel was the lone standard bearer for the province the ballymena man gave it a lash but his achilles problem and a bad lane draw meant a time of and an early exit james mcilroy gareth turnbull zoe brown and paul mckee all had to be content with watching the athens action on their television screens m hope mcilroy never got near his best during the summer and a fourth place in the british trials effectively ended his hopes of making the plane the injuryplagued turnbull gamely travelled round europe in search of the m qualifying mark but was the best he could achieve after missing several months training during the previous winter a lingering hamstring probem and a virus wrecked mckees athens ambitions and both he and turnbull deserve a slice of better fortune in pole vaulter brown had hoped for a vote of confidence from the british selectors after she had achieved the athens b standard but the call never came as the summer ended stalwarts catherina mckiernan and dermot donnelly hung up their competitive spikes mckiernan had to candidly acknowledge that time had crept up on her after several injuryravaged years donnelly and his annadale striders teammates later suffered tragedy when their friend and clubman andy campbell was found dead at his home on december a large turnout of athleticsloving folk turned out in west belfast to offer their respects to the campbell family and andys many friends as only death can it put the years athletics happenings in a sharp perspective sprinter walker quits athletics former european m champion dougie walker is to retire from athletics after a series of six operations left him struggling for fitness walker had hoped to compete in the new year sprint which is staged at musselburgh racecourse near edinburgh on tuesday and wednesday the yearold scot was suspended for two years in after testing positive for nandrolone i had intended to race but im running like a goon said walker he told the herald newspaper im not in great shape after missing about a month of training i missed a big chunk of speed work over about three weeks and then another week working in america if id had a halfdecent mark it might have motivated me more but i wont be racing i still enjoy training but feel its time to move on and concentrate on a career bekele sets sights on world mark olympic m champion kenenisa bekele is determined to add the world indoor two mile record at februarys norwich union grand prix in birmingham the yearold will again be chasing a record held by his compatriot and mentor haile gebrselassie who set the mark at the same meeting in i am still as hungry to do as much as i can in this sport said bekele and aiming for the two mile world record in birmingham is the next of those targets gebrselassies current record stands at eight minutes seconds and bekele is no stranger to overhauling world marks at the national indoor arena the ethiopian broke the world indoor m record on his debut at the meeting last year compatriots mulugeta wondimu abiyote abate and markos geneti the world indoor bronze medallist over m will race against bekele on february the meet has already attracted a crop of olympic talent britains m and m champion kelly holmes is taking part in the m swedish heptathlon gold medallist carolina kluft will contest the m hurdles while mens xm relay gold medallists jason gardener and mark lewisfrancis will go headtohead in the m athens memories soar above lows well its goodbye to another olympic year and as usual there were plenty of highs and lows in athens obviously theres no getting away from the differing fortunes of kelly holmes and paula radcliffe but i want to remind you of a few more events that made another year to remember or forget for athletics one of my favourite olympic moments was kellys success in the m winning that race was the key to her success because if she won that then the m would be a bit of a formality kelly had been full of should i shouldnt i thoughts about going for the double in athens i thought why wouldnt you do the m its your best event it was such good fun to commentate on her m and it was nice to be able to be part of her athens story the victory for the british mens xm relay team was a bit of a surprise but a great climax to the games i think the four of them jason gardener darren campbell marlon devonish and mark lewisfrancis knew deep down that it was their best chance of a medal the lads had run poorly in the individual sprints so maybe they did lift their game when they knew something was really at stake hicham el guerroujs olympic double is a much bigger achievement than kellys on a global scale he was the first man since for years to win both the m and m titles as soon as he had added the m crown and i had finished commentating i jumped up ran down the stairs pushed everyone out the way and just gave him a big hug he is one of the few african runners who has embraced the tradition of the mile and he loves to hear all the roger bannister stories hicham is someone i enjoy having a bit of time with even though my french and his english are not very good what happened to paula in athens this year is the obvious low on a personal level and for the expectations of the nation as well there were a set of circumstances around athens that conspired to produce a very dramatic ending which i think has been greatly misunderstood dropping out of the marathon was the right thing to do but starting in the m five days later was not wise that was her heart and not her head reacting paula had a lot of little things going wrong in her preparation and on the day things like niggling injuries not being able to do all her running sessions and feeling the pressure of the race looming ahead of her i think she came to the start line in athens physically and emotionally drained and if even the smallest thing doesnt feel right when you are preparing to race a marathon miles down the road it will hit you like a brick wall the positive thing to take from paulas olympics it that she will have learned a lot from it and so will a lot of people including me purely as a race paulas victory in the new york marathon has to go down as one of the most thrilling it was so nipandtuck between her and kenyas susan chepkemei and you dont usually get that kind of excitement in marathons it was also a real delight for all athletics fans because to use one of my favourite words paula showed real bouncebackability and it was a bit of a rarity for me too because i genuinely did not have an inkling how the race was going to pan out kelly and the xm boys victories papered over the cracks in the general performance of the british team we should be concerned that were not producing enough people who are capable of reaching finals at senior level the only individual mens finalist on the track was michael east in the m i am beginning to look down and wonder where are the new breed and thats where things begin to look even gloomier for british athletics as we did not win any medals at the world junior championships in italy dani barnes came fourth in the m and she was the highest finisher for team gb the thing is if we dont have athletes getting into the finals at junior level then it really doesnt look good for the beijing olympics and beyond i tell you what i really enjoyed this year benita johnson winning the world cross country championships back in march in the absence of paula we tend to think of the event as something of an african preserve so to have an australian come up and deliver such a surprise was something special to be honest im getting bored with all the drug scandals especially balco i just wish the whole thing would come to a head so we can move on having said that im always pleased when drugs cheats are caught because it shows the sport is standing up to it and not turning a blind eye anymore and one of the positive things to come out of balco is people are starting to blow the whistle we need more people to come forward and help the authorities kick out the cheats as regards the case against greek sprinters kostas kenteris and katerina thanou well suspicions have been hanging over kenteris for a while the bottom line is we cannot keep letting drugs damage the sport because if we do then it stops everyone enjoying it jones doping probe begins an investigation into doping claims against marion jones has been opened by the international olympic committee ioc president jacques rogge has set up a disciplinary body to look into claims by victor conte of balco laboratories jones who says she is innocent could lose all her olympic medals after conte said he gave her performanceenhancing drugs before the sydney olympics but rogge said it was too early to speculate about that hoping only that the truth will emerge any decision on the medals would be taken by the iocs executive board and could hinge on interpretation of a rule stating that olympic decisions can only be challenged within three years of the games closing the sydney olympics ended more than four years ago but world antidoping agency chief dick pound said the rule may not apply because the allegations are only coming out now we will find a way to deal with that pound said in a statement released through her attorney rich nichols jones repeated her innocence and vowed she would be cleared victor contes allegations are not true and the truth will be revealed for the world to see as the legal process moves forward she said conte is someone who is under federal indictment and has a record of issuing contradictory inconsistent statements radcliffe proves doubters wrong this wont go down as one of the greatest marathons of paulas career but as a test of character it was the toughest race shes ever taken part in a win in the new york marathon doesnt make up for the disappointment of athens in any shape or form but it will offer hope and reassurance for next year if paulas last experience of the year had been athens it would have been very difficult to look forward with any optimism she can now draw a line under this year and make plans about her future even if shed lost this race there would have been a lot of positives to take out of it she knows she can dig deep if she needs to it was a strong field with a number of the girls going into the race with expectations of winning and although two hours minutes wasnt one of paulas best times it wasnt far off the record on a difficult course i was speaking to paula in the leadup to this race and she said that in many ways she was facing a nowin situation she thought that if she won people would say why couldnt she do that in athens and if she lost people would say her career was over and a lot of people were wondering what would happen if paula was forced to drop out of this race as she did in the marathon and m in athens but that was never on the cards she might have been beaten but she would have kept running the reasons she was forced to pull out in athens the niggling injuries her lack of energy and the oppressive conditions werent at play here the only question was what position she could finish in most important of all despite all the hype in the media ahead of this race there were never doubts in paulas mind if she wasnt confident she wouldnt have run after all if youre the best in the world at an event youll always have expectations of winning now paula will take part in the run london km race in london at the end of the year have a wellearned rest over christmas and go into next year with a lot of optimism jones medals must go if guilty world antidoping agency wada chief dick pound says marion jones should be stripped of all her medals if found guilty of taking banned substances victor conte of balco laboratories claims the american sprinter regularly used drugs to enhance her performance if she is found guilty she should be stripped of all her medals and banned for two years said pound asked if there was a timescale as to what medals could be taken pound said that is not an issue at all however under international olympic committee ioc rules athletes can only be stripped of their medals if caught within three years of the event jones who won five medals at the olympics denies using drugs and says she will take legal action over contes allegations balco laboratories is the firm at the centre of a widereaching investigation into doping in the us pound continued if she has indeed taken drugs it is going to be a big disappointment for a lot of people gatlin and hayes win owen awards american olympic stars justin gatlin and joanna hayes have been named the winners of the jesse owens awards usa track fields usatf top honour gatlin won the closest m final in games history with a careerbest time of seconds in athens he also won bronze in the m and silver in the xm relay becoming the only male athlete to win three athletics medals this summer hayes set an olympic record of in winning the m hurdles established in the jesse owens awards named in honour of the late olympic great who won four gold medals at the berlin games are presented annually to the outstanding us male and female track and field performers the awards will be presented on december in conjunction with the usatf annual meeting in portland it is such a great honour to win the jesse owens award said gatlin it is one of the biggest honours in track and field and it is a great end to a great year hayes said knowing some of the great people who have won this award before me and knowing what it represents i feel a sense accomplishment and pride which lets me know that everything that i have worked for is and always will be worth it white admits to balco drugs link banned american sprinter kelli white says she knowingly took steroids given to her by bay area lab cooperative balco president victor conte conte faces a federal trial next year on charges of distributing steroids and tax evasion and white said at first he tried to cover up what he was doing hes the one who told me that it wasnt what he said it was white said in the san francisco chronicle but she added it was my decision to go to him not anybody elses white said conte at first told her the substance was flaxseed oil only to change his story later white failed a drugs test after winning the m and m titles at the world athletics championships she was subsequently handed a twoyear ban in may this year and has admitted taking the stimulant modafinil at first white claimed she took the drug to combat narcolepsy but she now takes full responsibility for her actions my whole belief about victor is that he was selling a product white said in the la times whether it be a good product or a bad product he was selling a product white was introduced to conte through her coach remy korchemy who is also a defendant in the balco case the yearold believes doping is so common in sport she felt compelled to cheat herself if she was to have any chance of winning i have no clue what its going to take to change that said white i would say i made a mistake and i would never ever go back i would never recommend anyone to take that route radcliffe eyes hard line on drugs paula radcliffe has called for all athletes found guilty on drugs charges to be treated as criminals the marathon world record holder believes more needs to be done to rid athletics of the suspicions and innuendoes which greet any fast time doping in sport is a criminal offence and should be treated as such the yearold told the sunday times it not only cheats other athletes but also cheats promoters sponsors and the general public radcliffes comments come at a time when several american sports stars are under suspicion of steroid use being caught in possession of a performanceenhancing drugs should carry a penalty she added the current system does not detect many of the substances being abused by athletes this means that often athletes do not know if they are competing on a level playing field if their hard work and sacrifice is being trumped by an easier scientific route often when an athlete puts in a good performance they are subjected to suspicions and innuendoes instead of praise having been on the receiving end of accusations like this i can testify as to how much this hurts kenteris denies faking road crash greek sprinter kostas kenteris has denied claims that he faked a motorbike crash to avoid a doping test days before the start of the olympics kenteris and fellow sprinter katerina thanou are set to learn if they will face criminal charges this week part of the investigation has centred on whether they staged the crash kenteris insisted the accident happened i went crazy when i found out i had supposedly missed a test and i wanted to rush to the olympic village kenteris speaking on greeces alter television station also claimed that he asked to be tested for banned substances in hospital after the crash i told the hospital which was an olympicsaccredited hospital to call the ioc and have me tested on the spot but noone came after a drama which dominated newspaper headlines in greece as athens prepared for the start of the athens games kenteris and thanou eventually withdrew but kenteris has continually protested his innocence and on sunday blamed greek olympic committee officials and his former coach christos tzekos for failing to inform him of the test the yearold insisted he will be happy if he is charged so he can clear his name if a decision is taken to have charges filed against me i will accept it gladly a prosecution means that the case will be cleared i want to go to the end and then well see whos right and who isnt kenteris a greek hero after winning gold in the m at the olympics in sydney also confirmed that he was due to light the flame at the athens opening ceremony i had even rehearsed lighting the cauldron he said greek pair set for hearing kostas kenteris and katerina thanou will fight the provisional twoyear bans imposed on them by the iaaf at an independent tribunal this weekend athletics ruling body took action against the pair for failing to take drugs tests before the athens olympics an independent tribunal of the greek track and field federation will meet to decide whether to ratify the sanction the sprint duo face charges of failing to give information on their location and refusing to submit to a drugs test kenteris lawyer gregory ioannidis told bbc sport we refute both charges as unsubstantiated and illogical there have been certain breaches in the correct application of the rules on behalf of the sporting authorities and their officials and these procedural breaches have also violated my clients rights there is also evidence that proves the fact that my client has been persecuted ioannidis who is a law lecturer at the university of buckingham added one of the important rights and foundations of law and justice that the accused should be presumed innocent unless proved otherwise has been tarnished the panel will also decide on the twoyear ban imposed on the athletes controversial coach christos tzekos by the iaaf kenteris the olympic m champion and thanou the womens m silver medallist from the same games in sydney quit the olympics on august after failing to give samples on the eve of the opening ceremony testers could not find them at the olympic village and the duo were later admitted to hospital after claiming to have been involved in a motorcycle accident they also missed tests in tel aviv chicago and athens before the games in imposing twoyear suspensions on the duo on december the iaaf described their explanations for missing the tests as unacceptable whatever the findings of the independent tribunal all parties will have the right to appeal to the court of arbitration for sport the tribunal hearing will take place at the hellenic olympic committee building it will start at gmt on saturday and is expected to finish early next week the tribunal panel will consist of five members president konstantinos panagopoulos and panagiotis dimakos haralabos hrisanthakis stilianos perakis and ioannis karmis kenteris and thanou also face criminal charges in greece for allegedly faking the motorcycle accident eight criminal charges have been laid against the sprinters as well as tzekos an eyewitness to the accident and hospital officials but there has been speculation that the charges could be dropped jones files conte lawsuit marion jones has filed a lawsuit for defamation against balco boss victor conte following his allegations that he gave her performanceenhancing drugs the sydney olympic gold medallist says conte damaged her reputation and she is seeking m m in the suit conte whose company is at the centre of a doping investigation made the claims in a us television programme he and three others were indicted in february by a federal grand jury for a variety of alleged offences in an email to the associated press on wednesday conte said i stand by everything i said jones won three gold medals and two bronzes in sydney in her lawsuit filed in the us district court in san francisco said the sprinter had passed a lie detector test and that she has never taken banned performanceenhancing drugs contes statements the suit added were false and malicious after the abc television program earlier this month jones lawyer richard nicholls said marion has steadfastly maintained her position throughout she has never ever used performanceenhancing drugs victor conte is a man facing a count federal indictment while marion jones is one of americas most decorated female athletes mr contes statements have been wildly contradictory mr conte chose to make unsubstantiated allegations on television while marion jones demanded to take and then passed a lie detector examination mr conte is simply not credible we challenge him to submit to the same lie detector procedure that marion jones passed the sports ruling body the iaaf is taking a cautious approach to contes allegations but contacted the us antidoping agency communications director nick davies said the iaaf would seek to contact conte for further information but davies stressed it would be up to the american authorities to decide whether they will take action against jones in light of contes television interview and the world governing body would monitor the situation closely if it is felt there is case to answer it would be for its national governing body usa track and field to take the appropriate disciplinary action he added the us antidoping agency has proved itself to be very diligent in its antidoping war and i am sure like ourselves they will be watching the television programme with great interest jones who is under investigation for steroid use by the us antidoping agency has continually denied ever taking illegal substances since being investigated in the balco scandal although she praised a zinc supplement conte marketed jones who did not win any medals in athens in august has never failed a drugs test meanwhile conte who has been charged along with three other men of distributing illegal steroids and money laundering is due to face trial in march iaaf awaits greek pairs response kostas kenteris and katerina thanou are yet to respond to doping charges from the international association of athletics federations iaaf the greek pair were charged after missing a series of routine drugs tests in tel aviv chicago and athens they have until midnight on december and an iaaf spokesman said were sure their responses are on their way if they do not respond or their explanations are rejected they will be provisionally banned from competition they will then face a hearing in front of the greek federation which will ultimately determine their fate their former coach christos tzekos has also been charged with distributing banned substances under iaaf rules the athletes could receive a maximum oneyear suspension kenteris and thanou already face a criminal trial after being charged with avoiding a drug test on the eve of the athens olympics and then faking a motorcyle crash no date for the trial has yet been set and again tzekos is also facing charges the iaaf issued an official warning to the trio last year after they were discovered training in qatar rather than in crete where they had said they would be all athletes must inform their national federations where they are at all times so they can be available for outofcompetition drugs tests but kenteris and thanou then went on to skip tests in tel aviv and chicago when they decided to fly back to greece early then just before the olympics the pair dramatically missed another test in athens and withdrew from the games holmes starts with gb events kelly holmes will start with a series of races in britain holmes will make her first track appearance on home soil since winning double olympic gold in januarys norwich union international in glasgow she will also run in the grand prix in birmingham in february and may defend her indoor aaa m title in sheffield earlier that month i am still competitive and still want to win she said im an athlete and i cant wait to get back on the track she added these events are also a great opportunity to thank the british public for the enormous levels of support they have given me from the moment i stepped off that plane from greece the glasgow meeting will see holmes compete over m in a fiveway match against sweden france russia and italy gebrselassie in london triple bid double olympic m champion haile gebrselassie will race in the london marathon for the next three years the ethiopian legend won sundays almeria halfmarathon in spain on his return from an operation on his achilles tendon he was third in london in in his first serious attempt at the marathon it is a coup for us to secure hailes presence for the next three years and it guarantees a quality race said race director david bedford gebrselassie will face olympic champion stefano baldini world champion jaouad gharib and archrival paul tergat the current world record holder if i didnt think i could win i would not be here said gebrselassie who has set world records on occasions in his illustrious career and is keen to add the marathon record to his collection there are a lot of fantastic runners in the race but i shall be doing my utmost to upset them thanou bullish over drugs hearing katerina thanou is confident she and fellow sprinter kostas kenteris will not be punished for missing drugs tests before the athens olympics the greek pair appeared at a hearing on saturday which will determine whether their provisional bans from athletics ruling body the iaaf should stand after five months we finally had the chance to give explanations i am confident and optimistic said thanou we presented new evidence to the committee that they were not aware of the athletes lawyer grigoris ioanidis said he believed the independent disciplinary committee set up by the greek athletics federation segas would find them innocent we are almost certain that the charges will be dropped said ioanidis we believe that we have presented a case that the charges are unreasonable thanou the olympic womens m silver medallist and sydney m champion kenteris were suspended by the iaaf for missing three drugs tests the third was supposed to take place on the eve of the athens games last august but the pair could not be found in the athletes village they were later taken to hospital after claiming to have been involved in a motorcycle accident thanous coach christos tzekos was also suspended by the iaaf we were asked by the disciplinary committee all kinds of questions about the night of august said tzekos we did not leave any gaps as far as i am concerned there is no such issue of refusing to be tested and i am very optimistic tzekos thanou and kenteris who have all denied the charges can expect a decision within a month deliberations will start after some additional documents are brought in by thursday said committee chairman kostas panagopoulos i estimate that the final ruling will be issued by the end of february holmes is hit by hamstring injury kelly holmes has been forced out of this weekends european indoor athletics championships after picking up a hamstring injury during training the double olympic champion said i am very disappointed that i have been forced to withdraw i can hardly walk at the moment and i wont be able to do any running for two or three weeks although ill be keeping fit as best i can holmes will have now have intensive treatment in south africa the yearold made a cautious start to the season but looked back to her best when she stormed to the m title at the birmingham grand prix days ago after that race and more progress in training holmes revealed she had decided to compete at the european indoors before her plans were wrecked last weekend on saturday night i pulled my hamstring running the last bend on my final m of the night said holmes i was going really really well when i felt a massive spasm in my left leg and my hamstring blew i saw the doctor here and he has said it is not serious but its frustrating missing madrid when i knew i was in great shape holmes has now been advised by her coach margot jennings not to rush back into training and it is unlikely she will compete again until the summer helen clitheroe now goes to madrid as the only british competitor in the womens m while there will be no representative in the m what now for kelly holmes last april kelly holmes spoke to the bbc sport website about her loneliness her fight to stay fit and her decision not to contest both the m and m at the olympics it just goes to show even the most meticulous and measured athletes cannot predict what fate has in store for them four months later holmes stormed to double olympic gold and has since been made a dame won the bbc sport personality of the year and written a book whilst still finding time to coach aspiring athletes with so much time spent in the spotlight holmes has increasingly dropped hints that her ambition on the track has begun to wilt and when asked about her plans for both the indoor and outdoor seasons ahead the yearold has repeatedly chosen to tick the dont know box holmes has now pulled out of this weekends european indoor championships where she was selected for both the m and m because of a hamstring injury but should we be surprised if the olympic champion over both those distances decides she just does not feel like racing anymore well its a lot easier being the double olympic champion being feted by everybody than training to be at the top in middle distance running points out former olympian and bbc pundit steve cram you have to have a real strong desire to carry on doing it even if youre very talented holmes drive and determination have always been unquestionable that is the reason she has battled back from a string of injuries that threatened to see her finish her career emptyhanded but alarm bells start ringing when the kent athlete begins questioning herself will i have as much commitment desire and energy to go through a major championship holmes asked in the new year that is what i dont know at holmes will also be aware that time is running out us m and m legend michael johnson a fivetime olympic gold medallist retired shortly after his th birthday as did britains double olympic champion decathlete daley thompson the physical demands of the daytoday grind will only get harder for holmes who has already admitted she doesnt like the training anymore whilst out on the circuit the allure of defeating a double olympic champion will spur her opponents on holmes will not want to needlessly suffer the indignity of being beaten unless she is certain she has a strong chance of winning any race she will not step onto the track but if the kent athlete finds the form that fuelled her ambitions last summer there are more prizes up for grabs the day after completing her double in athens the yearold revealed she would still like to win her first indoors title holmes wish could easily be met in madrid before she goes on to prepare for the outdoor season where there are still scores to be settled such as a first gold at the world championships in helsinki there is just one small truth which could gnaw away at holmes motivation the realisation that no matter how hard she trains nothing she wins now can surpass her achievements in athens on the other hand if those achievements cannot be matched shouldnt they be at least shared and celebrated you dont get the chance very often in your career to step onto the track as the double olympic champion agreed cram you want to be able to take your bow in front of the fans because its a fantastic feeling i think deep down kelly wants to run i think she will compete and run races on the circuits but whether or not she runs in the major championships is much less certain athletics fans had every reason to believe they would see the newlook kelly holmes tearing up the track again after her olympic glory she emphatically denied she planned to retire so why is holmes dragging her heels about making a decision on where when or whether to even bother competing again thats just kelly explains cram shes always been like that she enjoys people trying to guess what she is going to do next she knows every time she makes a pronouncement now its headline news kelly has to figure out for herself what it is she wants and that will be based on athletics decisions whether she can be competitive if she is fit enough to put her neck on the line and if she decides not to run again noone is going to turn round and say youre making the wrong decision gardener battles to narrow win jason gardener fought all the way to the line to narrowly claim the mens m title at the norwich union indoor trials and aaas championships the world m champion got off to a rolling start and had to dig deep to dip ahead of mark findlay and darren chin who both set personal bests it was a close race admitted gardener i stumbled out the blocks but my experience told through i still feel theres more life in me and i believe i can go faster gardeners performance in sheffield could have been affected by the news which he heard before his semifinal that his european record had been broken frenchman ronald pognon who will be a real threat at the european championships set a new time of onehundreth of a second faster than gardeners previous mark favourite delivered a powerful performance to take the womens m title in seconds youll see me in madrid and i feel there is a lot more to come along said the yearold katherine endacott battled hard to take second and dip under the european qualifying mark defending champion joice maduaka had pulled out of the final with a chest infection was on recordbreaking form as she stormed to the womens m hurdles crown the yearold set a new british record for the second time in seven days clocking seconds to finish ahead of rival diane allahgreen im so happy a tearful claxton told bbc sport all the years ive been running and im getting recognition claxtons time was also good enough to qualify for the european championships the mens m went to form in sheffield as dominated the race from start to finish the northern ireland athlete went off at a startling pace but had to hold off the challenge of welshman jimmy watkins over the final m to win in one minute seconds both mcilory and watkins who set a lifetime best of had already booked their places in madrid and were again well within the qualifying time i had to go out and go through all the gears before the europeans and i wont run again until then said mcilroy could not reach the european mark in the womens race as she crossed the line to win in olympic bronze heptathlon medallist rounded off a useful weekend with two more personal bests in sheffield the yearold reached m in the high jump and clocked secs in the heats of the m hurdles ive surprised myself said sotherton im starting to thrive on the pressure but if i dont perform then its not the end of the world pole vaulter made a winning return to major competition after a drugs ban the trafford athlete who has served a twoyear ban after testing positive for anabolic steroids clinched the title with a championship record m also set a new championship mark in the mens triple jump title in sheffield the yearold who has been training in australia over the winter landed m with his final effort the longest leap in the world this year i didnt have a clue said idowu ive not jumped indoors before and i just wanted the qualifying mark but this isnt a bad start and hopefully ill come back from madrid with a gold medal nathan douglas continued his steady progress this season as he set a lifetime best of m in second while jonathan moore took third and resumed their rivalry in the long jump competition both achieving the european standard commonwealth champion morgan reached a personal best of m on his very first jump and then promptly retired with a bruised heel olympian tomlinson tried to play catch up with his six jumps but had to settle for a seasons best jump of m i was advised not to jump by my doctor and so im pleased to come here and get the qualifying mark said tomlinson now based at loughborough sprinted past front runner catherine murphy in the final m to steal the womens m title the yearold ran a personal best of seconds to win her first indoor title walls time was just short of the qualifying mark something murphy already has irelands took the mens title in ahead of promising channel islands decathlete dale garland sudanese yearold rabah yusuf who is seeking british citizenship showed his raw talent as he burst through in third cleared the required m to qualify for the european championships and claim the aaas title in the womens high jump in the mens m powered to a new personal best of seven minutes seconds to defend his aaas title in style it was the first time in years the eightminute barrier has been broken at the championships and was just within the european mark took the womens m aaas title in the absence of kelly holmes her time of was not good enough to qualify for madrid but ovens had already opted out of the championships the mens race was won by who had to fight off a closing pack to claim the title in european medal chances improve what have the european indoor trials told us well i think we could be heading to the european championships with half a dozen medal prospects it was good to see athletes beginning to make steps forward to see a few new faces and there were lots of personal bests kicking around the best performance on the track for me was sarah claxtons win in the m hurdles running subeight seconds twice in a week puts her right up there and if she repeats that in madrid she will be close to picking up a medal but what was great about sundays performance was that she was under pressure to produce the goods when it counted diane allahgreen has been our best hurdler for some time now and i think she was surprised to be beaten by sarah and knowing that she got the better of diane in a headtohead race will give sarah confidence in the mens race on saturday allan scott was right in there and there is definitely more to come from him in fact the mens m hurdles is so strong i think the selectors will pick three hurdlers to go to madrid phillips idowu lit up the field events not only with his hair but also with his leap of m which puts him at the top of the world rankings i had a chat with him before the competition and he was really looking forward to getting out there he feels he is in great shape and has some big jumps inside him but then phillips always has a lot of the athletes said the runway was not very helpful so for phillips to jump like that is a good performance he is such a huge talent but just needs some consistency and if he does that then the big jumps will get even further across the board i thought kelly sotherton had a great weekend and continued to show she is developing she picked up three personal bests in the long jump high jump and m hurdles and you cant ask for more than that kelly will be up against carolina kluft in the pentathlon at the european championships but she has every chance of a medal on the basis of what weve seen so far she has a complicated training regime where different people help her with different disciplines but it seems to be working really well it wasnt all good news in sheffield i thought both the m races were disappointing in different ways jason gardener may have won but he wasnt at his best i chatted to him afterwards and he knows it was an offday for him hes there to be shot at and the other lads nearly got a big scalp out there in the womens race jeanette kwayke was hoping to run against defending champion joice maduaka the pair are enjoying a bit of rivalry but joice had to pull out with a chest infection if she had made the final i think jeanette would have gone a bit quicker janine whitlock competed well in the pole vault on her return following a twoyear drugs ban but the most disappointing thing in the wider view is that she is our best pole vaulter by a long way and that shouldnt be the case the event has moved on immensely since janine has been away and if there was more domestic competition i think that would help her a couple of other interesting topics to look out for are the citizenship issues surrounding mark findlay and rabah yusuf findlay is a londoner who has chosen to represent trinidad and tobago but has never run for them so he could still compete for great britain yusuf who came third in the m is from the sudan but is trying to gain british citizenship he came to britain as a high jumper but damaged his toe started doing more running and found his talent so we shall have to see what happens to both of them mcilroy wins m indoor title james mcilroy motored to the aaas indoor m title in sheffied on sunday in a time of one minute seconds the larne athlete dominated the race from start to finish although he had to hold off a late challenge from welshman jimmy watkins in the final metres i had to go out and go through all the gears before the europeans and i wont run again until then said mcilroy i though if i got lucky id get close to the british record but i blew up in the end mcilroy has been in superb form at the start of the season and will now start his buildup for the european indoors at madrid on march meanwhile paul brizzel and anna boyle reached the semifinals of the m hurdles with boyle setting a seasons best of in the womens m final ailis mcsweeney broke michelle carrolls longstanding irish record by clocking which left her in third place david gillick showed that he is a genuine medal contender in the european indoor championships by claiming an impressive m victory gillick was more than halfasecond clear when taking gold in outside his personal best set in saturdays semifinals the irishman is now the fastest european this season derval orourke broke her own irish m hurdles record by clocking which left her third behind new british record holder sarah claxton james nolan took second in the mens m behind neil speaight but the offaly man was outside the european indoor standard colin costello was seventh in the m final in deirdre ryan was second in the womens high jump with a clearance of m while aoife byrne took silver in the m in a personal best of lisburns kelly mcneice reid was seventh in the womens m while gary murray was th in the mens m meanwhile stephen cairns and jill shannon claimed the individual titles at saturdays northern ireland cross country championship in coleraine cairns came in ahead of paul rowan and allan bogle in the mens race willowfield claimed their first mens team title in years while shannon helped lagan valley win the womens team honours johnson edges out rival sotherton jade johnson edged out rival kelly sotherton with her last effort to claim the aaas long jump title at the norwich union european indoor trials olympic heptathlon bronze medallist sotherton led the event with her first leap of m a personal best but johnson who has not competed indoors for five years leapt to a lifetime best of m in her last jump after four fouls both johnson and sotherton passed the european championships qualifying mark although sothertons main aim in madrid next month will be the pentathlon where she will take on olympic heptathlon champion carolina kluft irelands delivered a shock in the mens m as he stormed to his first major title in seconds british favourite chris lambert had to settle for second place while defending champion irelands paul brizzel took third there was some consolation for lambert as he set a personal best of in the first round good enough to qualify for europe twotime aaas champion allyn condon and ian mackie had no such luck as they were disqualified in the heats there was plenty of hot action in the mens m hurdles where scotlands was vying for top spot with olympian andy turner scott smashed his personal best on the way to the final where he broke it again to win the aaas title in seconds turner finished second in after previously setting a personal best on the in the semifinals while damien greaves did not finish the final the trio of athletes have reached the european qualifying mark this season though one of them is set to miss out on a callup to the british squad comfortably defended her m title clocking eight minutes seconds to easily surpass the european qualifying mark the european cross country bronze medallist is ranked number one in europe this season and will go to madrid with high hopes helen clitheroe was agonisingly close to the qualifying mark as she claimed the runnersup spot in a personal best of in the mens m heats qualified fastest in the m heats to lay down a challenge to inform the welsh runner attacked the last m to come through ahead of james thie in one minute seconds mcilroy who is third in the european rankings eased across the finish in to set up a showdown in sundays final in sheffield both watkins and mcilroy have already achieved the european qualifying mark scotlands susan deacon stole s thunder in the final of the womens m fraser became the fastest british woman over the distance this season when she qualified for the final in seconds though that time is outside the european standard but deacon claimed her first aaas title over the distance edging fraser into second in in the womens shot put veteran claimed her fourth aaas title with a throw of m but that mark was not good enough for the yearold to book her place at next months european indoor championships in madrid sotherton finished fifth after producing two throws of m in the absence of injured british number one carl myerscough claimed the mens shot put title with a throw of m which was below the qualifying mark sales robert mitchell climbed to a seasons best of m just cm short of the european standard to claim the british indoor high jump title could only clear m to finish in fourth but the yearolds disappointment will be tempered as he had already achieved the qualifying mark at a meeting in slovenia on tuesday there was bad luck for british number one in the pole vault as he failed to clear the bar after deciding to come in at m the aaas indoor title went instead to ashley swain who climbed to a seasons best of m and irelands taniesha scanlon set a new national record of m in the womens triple jump holmes urged to compete at worlds jolanda ceplak has urged britains kelly holmes to continue competing at the major championships double olympic gold medallist holmes has strongly hinted she will not run in this years worlds and is undecided about next months european indoors but world indoor m record holder ceplak said there is never an easy race when she is in the field there is only excitement at what might happen it is good for the sport she always fetches the best out of everyone ceplak has been a great rival of holmes during the britons career and the pair fell out when holmes questioned the manner of the slovenians runaway m victory at the european championships but the controversy has since been forgotten with ceplak acting as pacemaker for holmes failed attempt on the british indoor m record at the norwich union grand prix in birmingham in ceplak added i like running against her you know the race is always going to be fast that is the sort of competition that i like she is special to me she was like my idol from the beginning of my career meanwhile ceplak will be looking to follow up last saturdays win in boston with a fast time and victory in fridays night of athletics in erfurt germany britains jason gardener had been expected to defend his m title in erfurt but instead he will save himself for a competition in leipzig on sunday gardeners decision means scotlands m man ian mackie will carry british hopes in what looks sure to be a tough preparation for next weekends norwich union european trials in sheffield radcliffe will compete in london paula radcliffe will compete in the flora london marathon this year after deciding her schedule for the yearold won the race in on her marathon debut defended her title months later and will now seek a third title in the april race it doesnt get any better than this for the th anniversary said race director david bedford after announcing the greatest mens field ever we now have the greatest womens distance runner ever three years ago radcliffe smashed the womens world record in two hours minutes seconds the bedford star returned to london months later lowering her mixedrace world record of which she set in chicago in october by one minute secs radcliffes career took a setback when she failed to complete the olympic marathon and later dropped out of the athens m last august but the yearold bounced back to win the new york marathon in november radcliffe however passed up the chance to go for the big city marathon grand slam with wins in chicago london and new york only the boston marathon remains to be conquered but that takes place a day after london boston is definitely a race i want to do at some point but london is very special to me said radcliffe i dont pick races thinking about things like pressure i pick the ones in my heart i really want to do i love the atmosphere crowds and course and know it will always be a great quality race it is also the th anniversary this year which adds to the occasion britain boosted by holmes double athletics fans endured a year of mixed emotions in as stunning victories went handinhand with disappointing defeats and more drugs scandals kelly holmes finally fulfilled her potential by storming to double gold on the track at the olympic games holmes helped erase the gloom hanging over team gb after their biggest medal hope paula radcliffe dropped out of the marathon and then the m britains mens xm relay team also did their bit by taking a shock gold holmes had started the year in disappointing style falling over in the final of m at the world indoor championships where she was favourite her olympic buildup was clouded by self doubt but that proved unfounded as she overhauled rival maria mutola to win the m her first global title just five days later the yearold made it double gold in the m it was the first time in years a briton has achieved the olympic middledistance double while holmes left athens as the star of team gb it was radcliffe who carried expectations before the august games the yearold marathon world record holder went into the athens event as favourite but an exhausted radcliffe dropped out after miles in tears her decision to enter the m five days later also backfired as she again pulled out with eight laps remaining but radcliffe helped put her olympic trauma behind her with a thrilling win in novembers new york marathon the xm team grabbed some lastgasp glory for the british mens olympic squad after a poor start to the games it seemed as though athens would be the first games where the men would fail to win a medal with michael east the only individual track finalist in the m but darren campell jason gardener marlon devonish and mark lewisfrancis made amends in the sprint relay the quartet held off favourites the usa to win britains first relay medal since in seconds gardener added the olympic relay crown to his world indoor title over m and just like holmes finally lived up to his promise in kelly sotherton completed team gbs athletics medal haul in athens with a surprise bronze in the heptathlon the yearold won her first championship medal since becoming a fulltime athlete in but it was a different story for britains defending champion denise lewis who withdrew on day two of the competition after some poor results lewis who was troubled by injury has ruled out retiring while sotherton is tipped to build on her success the athens olympics proved to be a landmark occasion for steve backley who retired from competition after finishing fourth in the javelin the battling yearold leaves the sport with a vast medal haul including two silvers and one olympic bronze and backleys departure was balanced by the return of injuryhit decathlete dean macey who came fourth in athens the continued improvement of sprinter abi oyepitan and long jumper chris tomlinson also boosted team gb sadly the olympics did not escape the problems of drugs misuse on the eve of the games greek sprinters kostas kenteris and katerina thanou missed a drugs test and claimed to have been involved in a road crash kenteris the m champion in and thanou have since been charged by the greek authorities and await trial at the games adrian annus hammer robert fazelas discus and irina korzhanenko shot were all stripped of their titles because of doping issues hungarian compatriots annus and fazelas both refused to give urine samples while russian korzhanenko tested positive for the steroid stanozolol the fallout from the thg scandal which rocked the sport in continued to impact in olympic year britains xm team took gold without the services of dwain chambers who was handed a twoyear ban in february after testing positive for steroid thg american kelli white was suspended and stripped of her world m and m titles after failing a drugs test and world m champion jerome young landed a life ban from us chiefs after a second doping offence russian pole vaulter yelena isinbayeva provided some light relief by smashing the world record seven times on her way to the world indoor and olympic titles her rivalry with compatriot svetlana feofanova livened up the field events moroccos hicham el guerrouj also delighted fans by racing to a historic olympic double in the m and m and though there was no paula radcliffe in the london marathon there was plenty of drama as kenyans evans rutto and margaret okayo took the titles rutto held on to win despite slipping on some cobblestones and tumbling into a barrier okayo also had to battle back after mistiming her tactics but clinched victory on her debut lewisfrancis eyeing world gold mark lewisfrancis says his olympic success has made him determined to bag world championship m gold in the yearold pipped maurice greene on the last leg of the xm relay in athens to take top honours for team gb but individually the birchfield harrier has yet to build on his world junior championship win four years ago the gold medal in athens has made me realise that i can get to the top level and i want to get there again it can happen i dont see why not he said lewisfrancis has still to decided what events will feature in his buildup to the worlds with one exception he has confirmed his participation in the norwich union grand prix in birmingham on february where he will take on another member of britains victorious mens relay team jason gardener over m he added its a bit too early to make any predictions for helsinki but i have my eyes open and i know i can be the best in the world gb select holmes for double bid kelly holmes has been chosen for both the m and m at next months european indoor championships despite not yet confirming her availability the doubleolympic champion is still undecided about whether to compete in her first european indoors in madrid but uk athletics chief max jones believes it is likely holmes will race he said its worth a punt isnt it shes gone back to training if shes confident she will pick one distance the programme does not permit both if holmes does take her place in the gb side she has already indicated that m will be her favoured distance under championship rules she does not have to decide until hours before the event begins in madrid on march jones added she was pleased with her run in birmingham at last weekends grand prix i am inclined to think she will compete it could depend on how training goes and she will have to be close to top form and he admitted holmes presence would be a great boost to the rest of the norwich union gb team she is a very good team member and is very good to have there he added meanwhile there is no surprises in the rest of the great britain team announced on tuesday defending m champion jason gardener is included and will be chasing his third successive gold medal he will be joined in the event by mark lewisfrancis runnerup behind him three years ago in vienna and new boy darren chin kelly sotherton has been invited by championship organisers to compete against carolina kluft in the pentathlon sotherton finished third in the olympic heptathlon in athens where the swede took gold there are newcomers at this level of competition in gbs strong team the championships will be the last to be attended by jones before he retires to be succeeded by dave collins jones said the olympic games is the overwhelming target for uka and therefore it is beneficial to start the next fouryear cycle with a notsopressurised major games the european indoor championships always provide a chance for the young and inexperienced to make a name for themselves and the current indoor season has produced some exciting new talent madrid is the first small step on a long journey to beijing and the

double olympic champion kelly holmes was back to her best as she comfortably won the m at the norwich union birmingham indoor grand prix the yearold running only her second competitive race of the season shook off the rust to win in two minutes seconds but she is still undecided about competing in the european championships in madrid from march ill probably be entered and make my mind up at the last minute she said my training hasnt gone as well as expected but ive got two weeks to decide i need to take my time and make sure i feel good about what im doing i felt very good here but with the crowd behind you you feel like you can do anything american was the eventual winner of the mens m race which almost ended in farce three athletes were disqualified for false starting including britains mark lewisfrancis who was the first man guilty of coming out of his blocks too quickly world m champion kim collins clinched second spot ahead of world m record holder and scotts training partner maurice greene jason gardeners unbeaten run came to an end as he came fifth and he will need to improve if he is to defend his european title in madrid you cant win them all said gardener afterwards and i was very disappointed as i know im capable of doing better russian was back on recordbreaking form in the pole vault at the national indoor arena the olympic champion set a new world mark of m to break her own record which she set just six days ago and beat russian rival svetlana feofanova it was isinbayevas th world record indoors or out since july im so happy and i will do my best to break the m barrier soon the yearold told bbc sport jamaicas stormed to a personal best of seconds to claim the womens m sprint belgian kim gevaert who will be one of the favourites for next months european title took second while american muna lee was third there was disappointment for british pair jeanette kwakye and joice maduaka who finished seventh and eighth respectively jamaican stretched her unbeaten record to races as she effortlessly claimed the m the olympic champion set a new indoor personal best of seconds the fastest time in the world this season fought off fellow briton tim abeyie to take the mens m in a personal best of continued her outstanding start to the season beating a strong international field which included twotime olympic m hurdles bronze medallist melissa morrison to claim the womens m hurdles the yearold briton clocked seconds while preeuropean championships favourite russian irina shevchenko finished down in sixth ethiopias failed in her bid to smash compatriot berhane aderes world m record but still won the event in emphatic style the olympic m champion was inside record pace but dropped off over the final third finishing in eight minutes seconds the fourth fastest time ever recorded for the event britains jo pavey bravely decided to go with defar as she strode away from the field and took second in a seasons best kenyan also missed out on the indoor m world record which hicham el guerrouj has held for the last eight years lagat settled for silver behind el guerrouj in athens and was almost four seconds short of the moroccans world best clocking in birmingham and was still struggling to find his form after the death of his fiancee this year the olympic m champion had comfortably led the mens two mile race after his younger brother tariku had set the pace but fellow ethiopian appeared ominously on bekeles shoulder with two laps to go before surging past him at the bell to win in jamaican made the most of a blistering start to take the mens m title in seconds world indoor champion alleyne francique faded badly and finished in fourth while american duo jerry harris and james davis took second and third respectively swede showed her class in the long jump as she stole top spot from jade johnson with the very last jump of the competition the olympic heptathlon gold medallist reached m to better johnsons mark of m her second personal best inside a week i was quite surprised because i didnt think id end up with second place said johnson who wore londons olympic bid slogan back the bid on her shorts but im pleased and hopefully ill get a bit better for the europeans i really want to win a medal won the mens event with a seasons best of m taking the scalp of world indoor champion savante stringfellow of the usa record fails to lift lacklustre meet yelena isinbayeva may have produced another world pole vault record but her achievement could not hide the fact it was not the best meet we have ever seen in birmingham and hey there are not many meets that go by without the russian breaking a world record apparently isinbayeva has cleared five metres in training and i would just love her to put us out of our misery and have a go at it rather than extending the indoor record by one centimetre at a time athletics to me is all about pushing the barriers and being the best you can and i would like to see her have a go at m in competition mind you every time she breaks the record she gets so she can afford to be deliberate about it world records aside i thought it was a very encouraging evenings work for kelly holmes she looked good and was very positive agnes samaria who came second is in very good shape and is in the worlds top three m runners this season yes samaria let kelly get away but there was no coming back over the last m as kelly dominated the race so beating samaria is a bit of a benchmark for kelly my gut feeling is that kelly would like to run in the european indoor championships but she just hasnt convinced herself she is fit enough to do so on the other hand i think jason gardener is struggling to come near what is going to be required to win the mens m in madrid he started well in the final but still could not stay with the frontrunners jason has a lot of experience indoors but for some reason he is struggling to maintain his pace through to the finish it would have been nice to see what mark lewisfrancis could have done in the final if only he hadnt got himself disqualified he was blatantly playing the falsestart game to his advantage but it tripped him up and made him look a bit silly my view is youre meant to go when the gun goes and not before and if you try to unsettle your rivals by employing the falsestart tactic you have to remember not to false start yourself again having said that mark is looking in much better shape but i havent seen anything from mark or jason yet which suggests frances ronald pognon who has run seconds will be under threat at the europeans from a british point of view sarah claxtons victory in the m hurdles was the best thing to come out of the meet something else that probably went unnoticed was melanie purkiss winning the womens national m race in a new personal best of seconds aaas champion kim wall came second in another lifetime best so we have a very strong xm squad going to the european championships scotlands lee mcconnell is probably going to run too so we have a real prospect of a medal from an international perspective i thought meseret defar was disappointing in the m but i dont think the pacemaking was great canadian heather hennigar set a fast early pace but could not maintain it and if jo pavey had been in last years shape she would have given defar a real run for her money she had a go but just could not hang in there we were also expecting a bit more from bernard lagat in the mens m but he has only just come over from the usa so he may not be that sharp and i still think he is in great shape as for kenenisa bekele he was well beaten by markos geneti but we only had half expectations for bekele as he has been struggling this season it was very hot in the national indoor arena and i felt uncomfortable in the commentary box i think those conditions affected the distance runners and in fact defar complained to her coach after the race that she could not get her breath properly tomlinson stays focused on europe long jumper chris tomlinson has cut his schedule to ensure he is fully fit for the european indoor championships the yearold has a minor injury and has pulled out of international meets in madrid and lievin this week as well as warmweather training in lanzarote its nothing serious said his coach peter stanley he strained a muscle in his abdomen at the birmingham meeting but is back in full training sprinter mark lewisfrancis will also not compete in madrid on thursday the birmingham athlete who clocked a seasons best of seconds over m in birmingham last week also prefers to focus his attentions on next months european indoor championships lewisfrancis who was runnerup to british teammate jason gardener at the europeans three years ago will continue his training at home meanwhile tomlinson is still searching for this first major medal and this season he has shown he could be in the sort of form to grab a spot on the podium in madrid the middlesbrough athlete jumped a seasons best of m at the birmingham grand prix good enough to push world indoor champion savante stringfellow into second running around the olympics it was back to official duties last week in my role as an ambassador to londons olympic bid but i still managed to do all my marathon training all the sporting people on the capitals bid team think im mad to be taking part in the london marathon the bid chairman lord coe admitted he would never dream of running a marathon even though he was an olympic middledistance runner kelly holmes former hurdler alan pascoe and former sprinter frankie fredericks who is now an ioc member all wanted to know why anyone would want to run that far youd have thought all these athletes who have been running for most of their lives wouldnt think it would be that bad but the only person who was positive about my intentions was tanni grey thompson who has won the london marathon wheelchair race six times even though it was a very busy week entertaining the international olympic committees ioc evaluation commission i actually found my running schedule easier to follow when im at home i get distracted by all sorts of things but for the five days i was in london i was in a pressurised situation but i found it easy to relax by running on wednesday the presentations to the ioc team did not finish until the early evening so i just managed to squeeze in a minute run we had an early start on thursday because we had to visit all the olympic sites around london that was pretty shattering but when we got back to the hotel i got back on the treadmill on friday evening i went along to the special dinner at buckingham palace which was a nice occasion i never feel guilty about eating especially when im exercising and because it was a rest day i didnt have to feel bad about missing my training either anyway i managed to do another quick run on saturday ahead of the final ioc presentations before heading home for my daughters birthday when i was in london i did all of my runs on the treadmill which isnt the same as exercising outdoors one of the iocs technical staff from australia ran alongside me one day we talked about the sydney olympics and that made the time go past more quickly i do find it quite comfortable running in the gym because there is more cushioning but when youre gearing up to running on the road you need your body to get used to that jarring feeling when your feet hit the pavement it was good to get out on the road for my long run on sunday after the week id had i was a bit concerned i wouldnt be able to complete it but i coped with it very well and even though it was bitterly cold i put in andahalf miles only another to go then this year steve will donate all the proceeds from his london marathon efforts to victims of the tsunamisteve will be writing a regular column on the ups and downs of his marathon training for the bbc sport websitehe will be raising money through the steve redgrave trust which supports the association of childrens hospices the children with leukaemia charity and the trusts own project which aims to provide innercity schools with rowing equipment gardener wins double in glasgow britains jason gardener enjoyed a double m success in glasgow in his first competitive outing since he won m relay gold at the athens olympics gardener cruised home ahead of scot nick smith to win the invitational race at the norwich union international he then recovered from a poor start in the second race to beat swede daniel persson and italys luca verdecchia his times of and seconds were well short of american maurice greenes m world record of secs from its a very hard record to break but i believe ive trained very well said the world indoor champion who hopes to get closer to the mark this season it was important to come out and make sure i got maximum points my last race was the olympic final and there was a lot of expectation this was just what i needed to sharpen up and get some race fitness im very excited about the next couple of months double olympic champion marked her first appearance on home soil since winning m and m gold in athens with a victory there was a third success for britain when edged out russias olga fedorova and swedens jenny kallur to win the womens m race in secs maduaka was unable to repeat the feat in the m finishing down in fourth as took the win for russia and the yearold also missed out on a podium place in the xm relay as the british quartet came in fourth with russia setting a new world indoor record there was a setback for jade johnson as she suffered a recurrence of her back injury in the long jump russia won the meeting with a final total of points with britain second on and france one point behind in third led the way for russia by producing a major shock in the high jump as he beat olympic champion stefan holm into second place to end the swedes event unbeaten record won the triple jump with a leap of m with britains tosin oke fourth in m won the mens pole vault competition with a clearance of m with britains nick buckfield cm adrift of his personal best in third and won the womens m with britains jenny meadows third there was yet another russian victory in the womens m as finished well clear of britains catherine murphy chris lambert had to settle for fourth after fading in the closing stages of the mens m race as swedens held off leslie djhone of france frances won the mens m with brett rund fourth for britain took victory for sweden in the womens m hurdles ahead of russias irina shevchenko and britains sarah claxton who set a new personal best italy grabbed their first victory in the mens m as kicked over the last metres to hold off britains james thie and frances alexis abraham a botched changeover in the xm relay cost britains men the chance to add further points as france claimed victory african double in edinburgh world m champion eliud kipchoge won the km race at the view from great edinburgh cross country the kenyan who was second when newcastle hosted the race last year was in front from the outset ethiopian duo gebre gebremariam and dejene berhanu made lastgasp efforts to overtake him but kipchoge responded and a burst of speed clinched victory gavin thompson was the first briton in th place while nick mccormick held of his british rivals to win the km race the morpeth harrier led from the end of the first lap and ended mike skinner and andrew baddeleys hopes with a surge in the lasp lap my training has gone so well i wasnt really worried about the opposition asi knew i was in great shape said mccormick who now hopes to earn a m place in the british team for the world championships in helsinki in the womens race ethiopias tirunesh dibaba won a battle with world cross country champion benita johnson to retain her title australian johnson who shocked her african rivals in brussels last march looked to be on course for another win in the km race but world m champion dibaba make a telling strike for the finishing line in the final metres britons kathy butler

briton karl keska battled bravely to finish seventh in the mens km race in a time of kenenisa bekele of ethiopia the reigning world long and short course champion was never troubled by any of the opposition winning leisurely in butler said of her success i felt great throughout the race and hope this is a good beginning for a marvellous season for me elsewhere abebe dinkessa of ethiopia won the brussels iaaf crosscountry race on sunday completing the m course in gelete burka then crowned a great day for ethiopia by claiming victory in the womens race wada will appeal against ruling the world antidoping agency wada will appeal against the acquittal of kostas kenteris and katerina thanou on doping charges if the iaaf does not the pair were cleared of charges relating to missing dope tests by the greek athletics federation last week wada chairman dick pound said i am convinced the iaaf will appeal against the decision and we will support them but if they accept the federations ruling we will go before the court of arbitration for sport he added kenteriss lawyer gregory ioannidis reacted angrily to pounds comments comments like these only help to embarrass the sporting governing bodies create a hostage situation for the iaaf and strengthen our case further he told bbc sport kenteris and thanou had been charged with avoiding drugs tests in tel aviv chicago and athens and failing to notify antidoping officials of their whereabouts before the olympics they withdrew from the athens games after missing a drugs test at the olympic village on august but an independent tribunal ruled that the duo had not been informed that they needed to attend a drugs test in athens however their former coach christos tzekos was banned for four years by the tribunal kenteris and thanou still have to face trial on charges brought separately by greek prosecutors of missing the drugs tests and faking a motorcycle accident to avoid testing at the athens games greek duo cleared in doping case sprinters kostas kenteris and katerina thanou have been cleared of doping offences by an independent tribunal the duo had been provisionally suspended by the iaaf for allegedly missing three drugs tests including one on the eve of the athens olympics but the greek athletics federation tribunal has overturned the bans a decision which the iaaf can now contest at the court of arbitration for sport the pairs former coach christos tzekos has been banned for four years kenteris and thanou had been charged with avoiding drug tests in tel aviv chicago and athens and failing to notify antidoping officials of their whereabouts before the olympics they withdrew from the olympics after missing a drugs test at the olympic village on august the pair then spent four days in a hospital claiming they had been injured in a motorcycle crash it was the international olympic committees demand that the iaaf investigate the affair that led to the hearing of the greek tribunal the head of that tribunal kostas panagopoulos said it had not been proven that the athletes refused to take the test in athens the charge cannot be substantiated he said in no way was he kenteris informed to appear for a doping test the same goes for thanou kenteriss lawyer gregory ioannidis said the decision means mr kenteris has been exonerated of highly damaging and unfounded charges which have been extremely harmful for his career he has consistently maintained his innocence and this was substantiated by further evidence we were able to submit to the tribunal following its deliberations in january this evidence shows mr kenteris was never asked to submit to a test by the international olympic committee so he could not possibly have been guilty of deliberately avoiding one it shows he has no case to answer mr kenteris should now be given the opportunity he deserves to rebuild his career in the full knowledge that there is no stain on his character he has suffered greatly throughout this ordeal that has exposed both himself and his family to enormous pressures but the iaaf said it was very surprised by the verdict spokesman nick davies said we note the decision of the greek authorities with interest our doping review board will now consider the english version of the decision johnson too strong for gb runners britains kathy butler and hayley yelling were no match for

vivancos who equalled the spanish record swedens robert kronberg was second with haitis dudley dorival in third scott was slightly disappointed with his run in the final he won his heat in secs but ran secs slower in his first iaaf indoor grand prix circuit final i should have done better than that he said i felt i could have won it i got a poor start but i still felt i should have ran faster

before the olympics but the decision was overturned the iaaf will decide if we can compete again in greece and abroad thanou told to vima newspaper in her first interview since the athens olympics if given the green light i will run again thats the only thing i want thanou and her compatriot kostas kenteris were provisionally suspended by the iaaf in december for missing three drugs tests the third was alleged to have been on the eve of the opening ceremony of the athens olympics but an independent tribunal of the greek athletics federation overturned the provisional ban on march the iaaf which said it was very surprised by the decision of the greek tribunal is deciding whether to appeal against the decision at the court of arbitration for sport however dick pound the chairman of the world antidoping authority has said he will appeal against the decision if the iaaf does not and thanou and kenteris face a criminal trial later this year for allegedly avoiding the test and then faking a motorcycle accident thanou said i can see how people can think the accident seemed like a childish excuse i cannot deny that we made a lot of mistakes during that time i always said we needed a pr person an athlete would have to be very stupid to take illegal substances when he or she knows that they will undergo tests at any given moment i am a champion i cannot risk everything ive achieved in such a silly way collins calls for chambers return world m champion kim collins says suspended sprinter dwain chambers should be allowed to compete in the olympics again chambers was banned for two years after testing positive for the anabolic steroid thg and his suspension runs out in november this year but collins says the british olympic association should reverse the decision to ban him from the olympics for life it was too harsh collins told radio five live they should reconsider chambers has been in america learning american football but has not ruled out a return to the track collins added he is a great guy and i have never had any problems with him we are friends i would like to see dwain come back and compete again he is a good person even though he made a mistake he understands what he did and should be given a chance once more costin aims for comeback in jamie costin should be paralysed he says so himself in a matteroffact way as he recalls the car accident which occurred nine days before he was scheduled to step out into the olympic stadium in athens for the k walk there is an ironic chuckle as he talks of his immediate thoughts after a lorry driving on the wrong side of the road had ploughed into his rental car i was in a lot of pain and i guessed that one of my toes was broken says the waterford man but i was thinking maybe with a cortisone injection you never know in my back it felt as though all the muscles had been ripped off my pelvis but i was thinking maybe we could do something with laser therapy and ultra sound and hopefully id be able to race it took over hours before jamie knew with certainty that he would not be competing in his second olympics my back had been broken in two places and with one of my vertebrae the bottom part had exploded so im fierce lucky not be paralysed id fractured my big toe as well which was on the brake jamie didnt finally arrive at hospital in athens until some nine and a half hours after the accident for the first nine hours i had no pain killers which was ridiculous in degrees heat but once i got the scans and saw them it was a case of moving on and thinkingok ive got a different set of circumstances now within three days he was arriving back in ireland by air ambulance doctors in athens had wanted to operate on jamies back immediately but he insisted on delaying any surgery until he arrived back home something he is now very relieved about the greek doctors were going to put three or four inch titanium rods either side of my spinal cord up through my vertebrae that would have fused all my lower back and i would never have been able to race again they were really putting a lot of pressure on me to agree to the surgery but when i got to the mater in dublin they said it was possible for it to heal totally naturally which is giving me the chance to get back into competition which is very important to me the people at the mater have been absolutely fantastic jamie had to wear a body cast for three and a half months after the accident and spent most of that time flat on his back he then progressed to crutches for six weeks until he was finally able to walk unaided on january walking without the crutches seemed like something finally really measurable in terms of my recovery physio sessions with johnston mcevoy in limerick have been a vital part of his recovery johnston uses an advanced type of acupuncture and its very effective needles get put right close up to my spine a two and a half inch needle went in yesterday and im fairly incapacitated today as a result jamie has also travelled to receive treatment at the polish training centre in spala where he has trained with triple olympic champion robert korzeniowski over the past five years i was there for over a fortnight earlier this month and underwent a fair extreme treatment called cryotherapy basically theres a small room which is cooled by liquid nitrogen to minus degrees centigrade and it promotes deep healing jamie heads to poland again on sunday where he will be having daily cryotherapy in addition to twicedaily physio sessions and poolwork all these sessions are small steps on the way to what jamie hopes will be a return to racing in its all about trying to get mobility in my back lying down for three and a half months didnt really help with the strength theres a lot of work involved in my recovery im doing about six hours a day between physio and pool work im also going to the gym to lift very light weights to try and build up my muscles im fairly full on with everything i do id hope to be training regularly by march but training is just part of the process of getting back at the moment every time i go and do a big bit of movement my whole pelvic area all down my lower back just tightens up its a case of waiting and seeing how it reacts hopefully after four or five months my back wont tighten up as much man utd stroll to cup win wayne rooney made a winning return to everton as manchester united cruised into the fa cup quarterfinals rooney received a hostile reception but goals in each half from quinton fortune and cristiano ronaldo silenced the jeers at goodison park fortune headed home after minutes before ronaldo scored when nigel martyn parried paul scholes freekick marcus bent missed evertons best chance when roy carroll who was later struck by a missile saved at his feet rooneys return was always going to be a potential flashpoint and he was involved in an angry exchange with a spectator even before kickoff and rooneys every touch was met with a deafening chorus of jeers from the crowd that once idolised the yearold everton started brightly and fortune needed to be alert to scramble away a header from bent near the goalline but that was the cue for united to take complete control with a supreme passing display on a goodison park pitch that was cutting up fortune gave united the lead after minutes rising to meet ronaldos cross from eight yards after the portuguese youngster had been allowed too much time and space by the hapless gary naysmith united dominated without creating too many clearcut chances and they almost paid the price for not making the most of their domination two minutes before halftime mikel arteta played a superb ball into the area but bent played onside by gabriel heintze hesitated and carroll plunged at his fee to save united almost doubled their lead after minutes when ronaldos low drive from yards took a deflection off tony hibbert but martyn dived to save brilliantly and martyn came to evertons rescue three minutes later when rooneys big moment almost arrived as he raced clean through but once again the veteran keeper was in outstanding form but there was nothing martyn could do when united doubled their lead after minutes as they doubled their advantage scholes freekick took a deflection and martyn could only parry the ball out for ronaldo who reacted first to score easily evertons problems worsened when james mcfadden limped off with an injury and there may be further trouble ahead for everton after goalkeeper carroll required treatment after he was struck on the head by a missile thrown from behind the goal rooneys desperate search for a goal on his return to everton was halted again by martyn in injurytime when he outpaced stubbs but once again martyn denied the england striker manchester united coach sir alex ferguson it was a fantastic performance by us in fairness i think everton have missed a couple of players and got some young players out the boy ronaldo is a fantastic player hes persistent and never gives in i dont know how many fouls he had he gets up and wants the ball again hes truly a fabulous player everton martyn hibbert yobo stubbs

rooney subs howard giggs smith miller spector referee r styles hampshire van nistelrooy set to return manchester united striker ruud van nistelrooy may make his comeback after an achilles tendon injury in the fa cup fifth round tie at everton on saturday he has been out of action for nearly three months and had targeted a return in the champions league tie with ac milan on february but manchester united manager sir alex ferguson hinted he may be back early he said there is a chance he could be involved at everton but well just have to see how he comes through training the yearold has been training in holland and ferguson said ruud comes back on tuesday and we need to assess how far on he is the training he has been doing in holland has been perfect and i am very satisfied with it even without van nistelrooy united made it wins in league games with a derby victory at manchester city on sunday but they will be boosted by the return of the dutch international who is the clubs top scorer this season with goals he has not played since aggravating the injury in the win against west brom on november ferguson was unhappy with van nistelrooy for not revealing he was carrying an injury united have also been hit by injuries to both alan smith and louis saha during van nistelrooys absence meaning wayne rooney has sometimes had to play in a lone role up front the teenager has responded with six goals in nine games including the first goal against city on sunday moyes uturn on beattie dismissal everton manager david moyes will discipline striker james beattie after all for his headbutt on chelsea defender william gallas the scot initially defended beattie whose dismissal put everton on the back foot in a game they ultimately lost saying gallas overreacted but he has had a rethink after looking over the video evidence again he said i believe that i should set the record straight by conceding that the dismissal was right and correct moyes added my comments on saturday came immediately after the final whistle and at a point when i had only had the opportunity to see one very quick rerun of the incident the club website also reported that beattie who seemed unrepentant after saturdays match insisting gallas would have stayed down a lot longer if he had headbutted him has now apologised moyes continued although the incident was totally out of character james has never even been suspended before in his career his actions were unacceptable and had a detrimental effect on his teammates james did issue a formal apology to myself his teammates and to the everton supporters immediately after the game and that was the right thing to have done he will now be subjected to the normal club discipline he is a competitive player but a fair player and i know how upset he is by what has happened however i must say that i do still believe the chelsea player in question did go down too easily speaking immediately after the game moyes said i dont think it was a sendingoff i have been a centrehalf in my time and i would have been ashamed to have gone down as easily as that not in a million years would john terry have gone down in the same way i have never heard of anybody butting somebody from behind while you are running after them what has happened to big strong centrehalves i thought it was a push initially and i still dont think it was a sendingoff an angry beattie initially said he gallas would have stayed down a lot longer if i had headbutted him i can tell you it wasnt an intentional headbutt we were chasing a ball into the corner and william gallas was looking over his shoulder and blocking me off he was stopping as we were running and i said to myself if youre going to stay in my way ill go straight over you our heads barely touched and it wasnt an intentional headbutt smith keen on home series return scotland manager walter smith has given his backing to the reinstatement of the home international series such a plan is to be proposed by the new chief executive of the northern irish fa howard wells at the next meeting of the four home countries the english fa has expressed doubt as to whether the fixtures could be accommodated at the end of each season but smith said bringing it back would add meaning to friendly games and thats something thats needed the home international series was done away with in with the traditional scotlandengland fixture continuing until that game is one smith would be delighted to see reinstated the scotland v england match was a highlight of the end of the season he added i was in italy for their friendly with russia last week and they made seven substitutions while only around fans turned up to watch england were criticised for the draw against holland the way scotland were slammed in the past for poor results in friendlies you have to put a performance on in friendly games if you dont they can be demotivating it can be a dangerous road to go down if players dont apply themselves in the manner they should so i would support the return of the home internationals the only problem would be fitting them in to the fixture schedule gerrard plays down european hopes steven gerrard has admitted that liverpool have little chance of winning the champions league this season the yearold reds skipper spoke out ahead of tuesdays first leg at home to bayer leverkusen in the last which he will miss through suspension lets be realistic there are some fantastic teams left in the champions league he told bbc radio five live we are just going to try to stay in as long as possible but we realise that maybe it is not our year this year gerrard has made no secret of his desire to be involved in europes premier club competition last season he described qualification for the champions league as the be all and end all and rumours persist that he will leave anfield if the reds fail to secure a place in the competition he has consistently been linked with a move away from liverpool with chelsea the favourites to snap up the england midfielder and blues boss jose mourinho backed gerrards view that rafael benitezs team could struggle to progress this season rafa has still time in front of him to build an even better team maybe hes a little bit behind right now he told bbc radio five live gerrard who fired liverpool into the last of this seasons competition with a brilliant goal in decembers win over olympiakos insisted he was still fully focused on helping liverpool to glory this season the reds are currently fifth in the premiership table five points off the crucial fourth spot which brings champions league qualification and they face chelsea in sundays carling cup final its big couple of months for liverpool he added were fighting for the fourth spot for the champions league for next season but we are still involved in two cup competitions which are very important we are confident we can upset chelsea in the carling cup final and get to the last eight of the champions league because financially it is big for the club and personally for myself it is very good duff ruled out of barcelona clash chelseas damien duff has been ruled out of wednesdays champions league clash with barcelona at the nou camp duff sustained a knee injury in the fa cup defeat at newcastle and manager jose mourinho said he cannot run his injury is very painful so he is out but mourinho has revealed defender willian gallas and striker didier drogba will be in the starting lineup the blues boss took the unusual step of naming his side a day before the match with jole cole named in midfield mourinho said we have one more session but i think drogba will play and gallas will play drogba trained on monday with no problems and will do the same on tuesday gallas feels he can play and wants to play we are protecting him still but he will be okay to play drogba chelseas m striker has missed the last three weeks through injury cech ferreira carvalho terry gallas tiago makelele lampard cole drogba gudjohnsen chelsea clinch cup in extratime after extratime score at mins john arne riise volleyed liverpool ahead after seconds but steven gerrard scored a thminute own goal blues boss jose mourinho was sent off for taunting liverpool fans after the goal and he watched on television as his side went on to win the game drogba and kezman scored from close range before antonio nunezs header made for a tense finale it was an amazing climax which gave mourinho his first silverware as chelsea manager yet it was controversial too after mourinhos sending off apparently for putting his finger to his lips to hush the liverpool fans there was no hushing them after the extraordinary opening in which the reds took a stunning lead inside the first minute riise could not have connected any better with morientes cross as he smashed a leftfoot volley past petr cech the goal the quickestever in a league cup final stunned a blues side whose previously rocksolid confidence had been shaken by consecutive losses to newcastle and barcelona in the previous week the blues attacking chances were limited and jerzy dudek was equal to frank lampards powerfullystruck drive and drogbas low shot despite their frustration chelsea began to dominate midfield without seriously threatening to break liverpools wellorganised defence joe cole had a shot blocked and a promising damien duff break was halted by a good tackle from djimi traore but the reds reached halftime without any major scares the blues began the second half with more urgency and pegged liverpool back nevertheless liverpool were living dangerously and they needed a fantastic double save from dudek on minutes first at full stretch from gudjohnsens header then to smother william gallas followup and despite chelseas possession it was liverpool who fashioned the next clear opportunity as luis garcia fed dietmar hamann whose shot forced a superb save from cech and the blues increasingly adventurous approach saw liverpool earn another chance on the break on minutes as paulo ferreira denied gerrard with a lastditch tackle but gerrard was on the scoresheet minutes later in the most unfortunate fashion as he inadvertently deflected ferreriras freekick past his own keeper and in off the post to bring chelsea level that prompted mourinhos reaction which saw him sent off but chelsea still pressed and duff had a chance to win the game with seven minutes remaining dudek saved bravely at the irishmans feet while milan baros shot wildly at the other end to ensure extra time drogba almost headed chelsea in front two minutes into extratime but the striker saw the ball rebound off the post but seconds after the halftime interval drogba made no mistake picking the ball up from glen johnsons long throw inside the sixyard box and sidefooting home and kezman appeared to have made the game safe as he netted from close range after gudjohnsens cross in the th minute there was still drama as nunez beat cech to a high ball with six minutes remaining to head his side level but despite liverpools desperate attacks chelsea clung on to win dudek finnan carragher hyypia traore biscan

the winner to end boltons game unbeaten run lee bowyer put newcastle ahead when he fed stephen carr on the right flank then sprinted into the area to power home a header from the resultant cross wanderers hit back through stelios giannakopoulos who ended a fluid passing move with a wellstruck volley but dyer had the last word in a game of few chances pouncing on a loose ball after alan shearers shot was blocked and firing into the top corner neither side lacked urgency in the early stages of the game with plenty of tackles flying in but opportunities in front of goal were harder to come by bolton keeper jussi jaaskelainen had to make two saves in quick succession midway through the firsthalf keeping out shearers low shot and dyers closerange header but that was the only goalmouth action of note and it was almost out of nothing that the magpies took the lead on minutes bowyer found space with a neat turn on the halfway line and striding forward picked out carr to his right he then continued his run and with perfect timing made his way into the box where he met carrs cross with a downward header into the far corner bolton had produced little going forward at this point but they responded well they were level within six minutes thanks to a smart finish from giannakopoulos jayjay okocha twisted and turned on the edge of the area and after a neat exchange of passes involving kevin davies and gary speed the greek striker found the bottom corner with a firsttime strike the magpies were opened up again before halftime as davies set giannakopoulos in space and given had to block at his near post but the home side survived and they should have retaken the lead with the first meaningful attack of the second half fernando hierro cynically chopped down dyer on the edge of the area with the midfielder clean through but the veteran defender escaped with a booking as there were other defenders nearby and from the resultant freekick laurent robert curled the ball just wide bolton were creating little going forward and they seemed content to frustrate the magpies their strategy seemed to be working until the th minute alan shearers snapshot was charged down and dyer reacted first to smash the ball past the despairing jaaskelainen from six yards bolton boss sam allardyce i am bitterly disappointed with the result but i am probably more disappointed with the secondhalf performance in the first half we had put them under a lot of pressure and our goal matched theirs in quality i thought it would lift us and that they might be tired after playing a lot of games but unfortunately we were not up for the battle in the second half we allowed them to heap too much pressure on us and in the end we cracked newcastle boss graeme souness we deserved the win we had a really good second half bolton are a difficult side to play you have to match them physically first but we did that and then we played some football we had a slow first minutes when we looked a bit tired but we got going after that the scoreline flattered them and we could have had one or two more goals newcastle given carr boumsong bramble babayaro dyer faye bowyer robert jenas

chris riggott stroked home the equaliser shaun bartletts strike put charlton back in front but that lead lasted just six minutes before graham rushed onto queudrues pass to head home the match burst to life from the whistle and charlton defender hermann hreidarsson had sight of an open goal after just six minutes hreidarsson received danny murphys freekick from the right but he crashed his free header wide of the far post the iceland international looked such a danger the boro bench could be heard issuing frantic instructions to mark him charltons early pressure paid off when bartlett received a long ball from talal el karkouri in the box and laid it off to holland who buried his rightfooted strike szilard nemeth recalled in place of josephdesire job was twice denied his chance to get middlesbrough back on level terms by dean kiely the striker played a great onetwo with jimmy floyd hasselbaink only to see kiely get down well to smother his shot before directing a header straight into the keepers arms boro had plenty of time on the ball but the addicks comfortably mopped up the pressure with kiely tipping a hasselbaink header over the bar to take their lead into halftime it was all oneway traffic after the break at the riverside as middlesbrough poured forward and kiely even saved hreidarssons blushes when he palmed the ball away to prevent a charlton own goal but the addicks keeper could do nothing about riggotts equaliser in the th minute the boro defender looked suspiciously offside as he got on the end of gareth southgates misdirected effort but despite the charlton protests his goal stood the addicks did not let their heads drop and bartlett left the boro defence standing picking up hreidarssons cross to easily sink his rightfooted strike but substitute graham was on hand to grab a share of the points for the home side the yearold striker nodding home the equaliser and his first premiership goal with five minutes left on the clock i felt we did enough to win the game even though the first half was lacklustre we dominated after the break the players showed a fantastic response and we should have gone on to win but for charlton goalkeeper dean kiely who made three tremendous saves we could have scored five or six to take the lead and then to get penned back it feels a little bit like a defeat admitted kiely we were winning but middlesbrough kept knocking on the door but we stood up and credit to us we didnt capitulate well kick on now our shortterm ambition is to progress from the seventh place finish from last year

turn making it tony bullock in the united goal was called into action for the first time with just over a quarterofanhour on the clock noel whelan laid the ball off to jamie winter on the edge of the box but his firsttime effort was gathered by the united keeper moments later though the home side took the lead barry robson whipped in a free kick from the right which stevie crawford caught on the volley russell anderson failed to deal with it and whelans clearance off the line landed kindly at the feet of archibald who poked the ball into the net united doubled their lead after minutes when grady tapped the ball into an empty net after robson had headed mark wilsons cross off the angle of post and bar but only three minutes later aberdeen clawed their way back into the match a free kick from the left by winter was met powerfully by the head of byrne at the back post leaving bullock helpless united restored their twogoal lead four minutes before the end of a highly entertaining first half jason scotland played a perfectlyweighted pass into the path of the onrushing crawford and he coolly beat ryan esson from yards united ended the game as a contest just two minutes after the interval grady received a pass from crawford with his back to goal on the edge of the box and after taking one touch he spun to volley the ball past the despairing dive of esson the home side were in complete control and it required a good stop from esson to keep out robsons drive after minutes the keeper denied the same player again minutes later beating away his fierce shot from the left of the

a goal chopped off before stan varga headed celtic into the lead alan thompson scored from the penalty spot at the start of the second half after shaun maloney had been fouled stilian petrov slid in a third varga tapped in his second and craig bellamy completed the rout with a fine drive bryn halliwell was the busier keeper early on saving from bellamy chris sutton and juninho clyde had the ball in the net after halfanhour through a tremendous strike from bryson but the referee had already blown for a foul by petrov from the resulting free kick darren sheridan curled the ball round the celtic wall only for the post to deny him back at the other end halliwell did well to come off his line and block bellamys effort to lift the ball over him the keeper misjudged a corner that stephane henchoz headed wide but a similar scenario five minutes before the break led to the opening goal the ball was delivered from the left and halliwell was left floundering as varga glanced the ball into the net maloney replaced the injured sutton at half time and he marked his first competitive appearance after a year out injured by helping his side take a twogoal lead just after the break the young striker fired a free kick straight into the clyde wall but as he collected the rebound he was tripped by bryson and thompson converted the penalty sheridan and bellamy were involved in something of a flareup that led to both being booked after the intervention of the assistant referee juninho brought out another good save from halliwell and then petrov saw a tremendous effort come off the top of the bar but petrov and juninho combined brilliantly to allow the bulgarian to make it on the hour mark a quick onetwo giving him the time and space to steer the ball past halliwell from yards varga got his second goal of the game as celtic drove home their advantage thompson whipped in a corner from the right and the unmarked defender simply tapped the ball over the line from a couple of yards out celtic were utterly dominant by this stage and bellamy opened his scoring account for the club after a fine move involving aiden mcgeady jackie mcnamara and maloney culminated in the welshman

their lead mikoliunas sprinted down the right crossed to the back post where mcallister raced in to head past meldrum moments later miller came close to grabbing his second with a firsttime drive from yards which skimmed the bar then mcallister picked up a pass from stephen simmons and drove an angled shot from yards narrowly past meldrums far post the impressive mikoliunas twice went close before half time a low drive was comfortably gathered by meldrum and then he curled a leftfooted shot past the keepers righthand post livi manager richard gough made three changes at the interval bringing on defender goran stanic midfielder gabor vincze and striker ferenc horvath for bahoken derek lilley and mark wilson but in the opening stages of the second period little changed however the west lothian

striker ignored the pass however and dair ran on to it and played easton in at the back post and he headed home from close range the home side called for offside against mcpake but referee alan

for sale but when asked if gerrard would be a liverpool player on the first day of next season parry said i sincerely hope he will be steven knows my views he knows rafas views we have reaffirmed recently to steven that we are trying to build a team around him we crave success as much as he does we know hes ambitious and nobody can argue with that i think steven would dearly love to win things with liverpool more than hed like to do anything else we all want to see progress by next season hes not alone in that there are a lot of other players who feel the same so we all have a common aim it is expected chelsea will test liverpool with a mplus bid in the summer but parry claims he will be in no mood to listen there have been a lot of open secrets about steven most of which have been complete myths it is suggested we had a deal tied up last summer we didnt had an offer last summer parry explained we had told chelsea that as far as we were concerned he was not for sale and we didnt want to sell him in reality it didnt go beyond that maybe there will be an offer in the summer maybe there wont our position is we want steven to stay but we are also realistic enough and have enough respect for steven and he has enough respect for us to know that it is his decision that will be crucial you are not going to keep a player like steven against his will that just doesnt work but any idea we are going to accept offers for steven and then tell him by the way weve decided to sell you is not on the agenda you can forget that parry is currently in the process of finalising funding for liverpools new stadium in stanley park which is set to open in and he confessed arsenals m deal with emirates to sponsor their new ground complete with naming rights has given the anfield club serious food for thought he said i have to say historically it is something i have been against and i have been on record as saying that but i think the size of the arsenal deal is a real eyeopener i would say in the past deals have been done frankly far too cheaply and it just hasnt even been worth contemplating but the arsenal deal is the sort of deal that causes you to draw breath and say wow thats interesting my personal point of view is that i would find it a hell of a lot more palatable than a shared stadium some liverpool fans would find such a move highly controversial but parry countered i recognise it would be an emotive issue for many supporters but you look at the amount of money available and it could go into the team if it was the right partner how strong an issue is it time will tell i think the stadium will always be anfield not least because of where it is but do we need to investigate the possibilities of sponsorship i think it would be remiss not to thats not to say we have made a decision that we will go down that road but i think it is clearly something we have to explore on the subject of possible new investment parry revealed liverpool are still in negotiations with a mystery investor with rumours of interest from the middle east that prompted the withdrawal of tycoon steve morgan who got frustrated by failed bids and what he claimed was indecision by the board he also accused liverpool of using him as a stalking horse to attract other bids but parry explained steve has never been used as a stalking horse theres no need and that is not the way we do business we had discussions with steve over the course of i think we came close to concluding a deal in the summer but it didnt happen quite genuinely the new interest did appear relatively late in the day just prior to the agm in december and as i have said it was of such potential magnitude and that potential is so exciting we felt we had to evaluate it we are still evaluating it steves interest was taken very much on its own merits his enthusiasm for the club is there for all to see and who knows what the next few months will hold the door isnt closed on anything we had a perfectly sensible dialogue with steve last year we have a common interest in making liverpool successful thats a dream we all share so as far as im concerned the door is not closed i would take m if we had no investment but if we did keep him as for the stadium if it gets us cash what difference does it make really m for gerrard i dont care who you are the directors would take the money and it is the way it should be we cannot let that sum of money go despite gerrards quality through a cleverly worded statement the club has effectively forced gerrard to publicly make the decision for himself which i think is the right thing to do critical time for liverpool with regards to gerrard ideally we would want to secure his future to the club for the long term i am hoping he doesnt walk out of the club like michael owen did for very little cash m realistically would allow rafa to completely rebuild the squad however if we can afford to do this and keep gerrard we will be better for it i would however be happy with gerrards transfer for any fee over m parrys statements are clever in that any future gerrard transfer cannot be construed as a lack of ambition by the club to not try and keep their best players upping the ante is another smart move by parry i would keep gerrard no amount of money could replace his obvious love of the club and determination to succeed the key is if gerrard comes out and says that he is happy clearly if he isnt then we would be foolish not to sell the worrying thing is who would you buy or who would come pending possible nonchampions league football giggs handed wales leading role ryan giggs will captain wales as he wins his th cap in wednesdays friendly against hungary in cardiff john toshack in his first game as coach after succeeding mark hughes admits he is surprised that giggs has only just reached the landmark with the games hes played for united proportionately it doesnt seem that many for wales toshack said but hes one of the greatest of all welsh internationals and on his th cap its appropriate hes captain giggs admits he had briefly considered retirement from the international game but is now targetting playing for wales in the european championships the manchester united wing revealed how club manager sir alex ferguson talked him into extending his wales career i briefly discussed my international future with sir alex but he urged me to carry on giggs said he feels like myself that i have no weight problems and keep myself fit so in three or four years time i will be able to play in the european finals if we get there the manager has always wanted me to play for my club and country and he was keen for me to continue because i am fit enough giggs admits he was wavering and considering joining the likes of former wales skipper gary speed and united teammate paul scholes in committing the remaining years of his career to club football but giggs is now focussed on making the toshack era even more successful than the time hughes spent at the helm the manchester united winger won his first cap as a yearold in an away loss to germany and now faces his landmark appearance at the age of with giggs leading wales out against hungary there is every chance that he will become the permanent successor to speed however toshack refused to reveal whether he sees giggs as a longterm option for this particular game i think it is appropriate that ryan giggs will be captain its his th cap and hes known for some time about that toshack said on wednesday night toshack takes charge of his first match since replacing hughes and giggs said its my th cap and i am looking forward to it and i hope to play a lot more times from here on in its important to be here all the players feel the same its a new start and all the top players certainly see it as important i see myself leading by example it is something i have taken on for wales as well as united these past few seasons the way john is looking at things he is aiming to build his side around the experienced lads right up to the next tournament the euro event i have told john i will be around for the next european tournament by then i will be so hopefully i will still be okay a lot can happen but im hoping to be around giggs own personal future at old trafford is still up in the air as he has yet to reach agreement on a new contract with manchester united offering one extra year and giggs seeking two i have put the contract thing to the back of my mind at the moment said giggs it is an important period for the club and i am just concentrated on that ive heard the suggestions hopefully there is a twoyear deal about to be offered because that is what i am looking for to get it sorted out im enjoying my football the way united have been playing and my own form you have to enjoy it we have massive games coming up manchester city this week then the everton cup tie followed by ac milan in the champions league and my first wales game under john toshack so its an important time bosvelt optimistic over new deal manchester citys paul bosvelt will find out within a month whether he is to be offered a new oneyear deal the yearold dutch midfielder is out of contract in the summer and although his age may count against him he feels he can play on for another season i told the club i would like to stay for one more year they promised me an answer within the next month so i am waiting to see he said the main concern is my age but i think i have proved i am fit enough bosvelt joined city from feyenoord in and at first he struggled to adapt to life in england but his professionalism and dedication impressed manager kevin keegan he realised the pace of the game was faster than anything he was used to but he drove himself back into the team he is an unsung hero said keegan time to get tough on friendlies for an international manager a friendly provides an important opportunity to work with your players the only problem is that the game itself can often be a farce some people have been saying it would be better to get the players together for the week and do away with the minutes at the end i would say its whether you should have these games or not and if you look at it that way you would probably say youre better not doing so it would certainly keep club managers happy as it would reduce the risk of players returning to domestic duty injured but international bosses will tell you that scrapping friendlies is counterproductive because the only way for a team to get better is by playing the more you play together the easier it is when it comes to the crunch in games like world cup quarterfinals against brazil often in friendlies though a manager will play his strongest side for the first minutes and then send out an entirely different one in the second half and its very difficult for any player to come on as substitute in a side with a few changes let alone a whole teams worth the debate will rage on and im not sure there is a satisfactory solution one manager who has got it right this week is walter smith the new scotland manager has decided to have a training camp instead of a friendly for his first international week since replacing berti vogts it is the sort of move you would expect from walter who is a canny manager the players have had such a hard time recently that he is better off getting them together in a relaxed atmosphere and trying to generate some team spirit before the next world cup qualifiers if he had sent them out on wednesday and they had been badly beaten it would have done them no good whatsoever john toshack has his first game in charge of wales and it will be important for him to get a decent result against hungary he will have his own ideas on individuals and how to play and will probably look more at the performance but the public wants results its extremely difficult to get the balance for friendlies if you win people forget them but if you lose it becomes a stat that can be used against you englands game against holland is a good example it looks like a good opportunity to try out players like middlesbrough winger stewart downing or crystal palace striker andy johnson but you have got to remember svengoran erikssons side were given a lesson by spain in the last game they played the injury problems in defence should at least give the likes of wes brown and jamie carragher a chance to impress for the club managers it will simply be a case of waiting at home with fingers crossed parry puts gerrard above money listen to the full interview on sport on five and the bbc sport website from gmt but parry speaking exclusively to bbc sport also admits gerrard who has been constantly linked with chelsea will have the final say on his future he told bbc five live steven is above money he is the future of liverpool it doesnt matter if its m m or m we will not accept offers but we are also realistic enough to know we cant keep steven against his will on the subject of liverpools finances parry also revealed the club is ready to explore the possibility of a sponsorship deal for its proposed new stadium and responding to criticism from bbc sport pundit and former liverpool stalwart alan hansen he insisted talks on new investment are ongoing but added the door has not closed on shareholder and lifelong fan steve morgan

anything yet he said it is obviously going to be a difficult replay judging by the way brentford came back at us on saturday and the fact that united have come out of the hat will give them even more incentive but ive been drawn against united so many times in cups and beaten them at both bournemouth and west ham there are no easy ties in the fa cup and im sure nobody is counting on one newcastle

problem for wednesdays match at villa park injured rio ferdinand and sol campbell were both left out of the squad and matthew upson has already pulled out wes brown and jamie carragher are likely to be the makeshift partnership terry the captain of chelsea as they push for the premiership title would have been a certain starter in the absence of campbell and ferdinand but now he has pulled out with a bruised knee and is likely to be replaced by carragher alongside brown manchester uniteds brown last played for england in the defeat by australia at upton park in february the yearold was only called into the squad on sunday night as cover following the enforced withdrawal of upson who has a hamstring injury and brown now looks certain to add to his tally of seven senior appearances for

to buy manchester united the club have confirmed that the glazer family partnership have submitted proposals of a third bid a lot of people want the clubs interest to be with people who have grown up with the club and have got its interests at heart said ferdinand no one knows what this guy will be bringing to the table the central defender added on bbc radio five live we will have to wait and see what glazer comes with i would like to see the situation resolved either way i think people are getting bored with him coming in and out of the news with new proposals the other stuff off the pitch takes the shine off what is going on the pitch glazer currently owns a stake in the club and uniteds statement to the stock exchange said the board has noted the recent press speculation on this subject the board can confirm that it has now received a detailed proposal subject to various preconditions which may form the basis of an offer for manchester united from glazer a further announcement will be made in due course glazers previous bids for the club which united supporters opposed were rejected by the board because of the high level of debt they would incur but it is believed that glazer has substantially reduced the borrowing required for his latest move he will still need the approval of major shareholders john magnier and jp mcmanus who own of the club to succeed but the irish duo have cut off talks with glazer over the proposed sale of their stake while fans remain opposed to his involvement kewell waits as injury drags on liverpool winger harry

squad for a threeday gettogether near manchester in preference to playing a friendly while qualification for the world cup appears to be beyond scotland smith is anxious that the remainder of the campaign should be positive i think we have got to try to get a bit of respectability back in whatever way we can he said we will have to approach each game differently obviously we will have to approach the italian game away from home in a different manner to moldova at home we have to meet the challenge of each match smith meeting a number of his squad for the first time brought them together on monday to outline his ideas for improving the nations fortunes he said i pointed out how i see the international team going forward and that was the main topic this is a relaxed gathering and i dont think there is a lot of doom and gloom about the squad that a lot of people think exists a man squad will spend the next three days based at the mottram hall hotel in cheshire and will

fulham but mick mccarthys side appear to have won the race but larne boss jimmy mcgeough has yet to confirm that weir is on his way from inver park i heard on sunday that he has joined sunderland but not from the lad himself he said robbie has an agreement with larne that he can negotiate with interested clubs personally i would rather see him making an impact at local level to build up his physique before moving into the fulltime game he has been on trial with a number of clubs but it would be great to see him making it at sunderland newry to fight cup exit in courts newry city are expected to discuss legal avenues on friday regarding overturning their ejection from the nationwide irish cup the ifa upheld its original decision to throw newry out of the cup following the andy crawford registration row a law firm will put a case forward for newry fc and see what the legal implications of all this is are said newry boss roy mccreadie this is a big issue now that we have an appeal pending on wednesday a fresh ifa hearing into crawford registration saga ruled that last weeks original verdict had been correct it meant that bangor beaten by newry on the field will take on portadown in the sixth round newry had claimed they had uncovered fresh evidence in respect of the dates relating to the registration but mccreadie is not further annoyed that full details of wednesdays meeting was not relayed to the club even to this day we have as much information about what happened during the meeting on wednesday as that told to the media we are being kept in the dark mccreadie told the news letter we want an explanation there is no good sending us the same fax message the press people received its a real sad case if we are not back in the irish cup after our appeal and guided by our legal advise we will seek to lodge an injunction in the courts to stop bangor playing portadown republic to face china and italy the republic of ireland have arranged friendlies against china and italy which will take place at lansdowne road in march and august brian kerrs side will face the th ranked chinese on march just three days after the world cup qualifier against israel in tel aviv italy will visit on august in what will be a warmup game ahead of the autumn world cup qualifiers in their last meeting the irish beat italy in the world cup finals however that is the republics only victory in eight attempts against the italians who have won all the other seven games the march game will be the second time the republic have played china the previous encounter back in june with the irish winning in sapporo japan brian kerr said china have made great progress over the last few years and will provide difficult opposition we all witnessed the performances of the asian teams in the last world cup and china play a similar type of football as for italy they make a welcome return to dublin and will be a massive attraction because they are one of the great traditional powers in the world the game will be ideal preparation for the three important world cup qualifiers in the autumn ireland round off their world cup campaign with games against france on september cyprus on october and switzerland on october finnan says irish can win group steve finnan believes the republic of ireland can qualify directly for the world cup finals after saturdays superb display in the draw in paris ireland face minnows the faroe islands in dublin on wednesday the versatile finnan who starred against the french is confident the group is irelands for the taking there is a chance for us now to go on win our home games and why not win the group even though its a tough one said the liverpool player switzerland ireland france and israel are all now tied on five points from three matches although the republic look to have a slight edge after claiming away draws in basel and paris in basel we did not play great football but when you to go to these places the other teams are going to have the majority of the game in paris we looked good throughout the team and a point was the least we deserved because we had a number of chances looking back we had an opportunity to get the three points but we are happy with a point and that will give us confidence going into wednesdays game on paper we have got the toughest matches out of the way and we have set standards for ourselves automatic qualification is there it would certainly be good to avoid a playoff but on the back of a couple of good results i dont see why we cant win the group manager brian kerr was keen to mention the contribution of stephen carr and finnan on irelands right flank at the stade de france finnans normal position is rightback but he looked assured in a more advanced position against the french as i play on the right for my club and being a natural rightback it was something he kerr looked at because france play strongly down the lefthand side so i was happy to play and stephen carr and i enjoyed the game particularly as the defence and midfield held together well and nullified their attacks irish finish with home game republic of ireland manager brian kerr

the german club said the player had pulled out because of a back injury iran refuses to recognise israels right to exist and does not allow its citizens to travel to the country a bayern spokesman said on monday that the decision not to take hashemian to israel had been motivated only by his physical condition hes got back pain and he couldnt train the spokesman said it would have made no sense

tunnel incident prior to the arsenal and manchester united game arsenals patrick vieira had earlier denied accusations that he threatened gary neville before the defeat vieira also clashed with opposing skipper roy keane and referee graham poll had to separate them the referee has confirmed that he is satisfied he dealt with the incident at the time said an fa statement it means uniteds win will pass off without further intervention from the governing body whose new chief executive brian barwick was in the highbury stands i didnt threaten anybody they are big enough players to handle themselves said vieira i had a talk with roy keane and thats it gary neville is a big lad he can handle himself they just played better than us and deserved to win neville admitted there had been incidents before the game but insisted it had not distracted his focus there were a couple of things that did happen before the game which disappoint you he said especially from players of that calibre but its a tough game and weve been around a long time neville admitted that he had not enjoyed the match which was punctuated by fouls and the sending off of mikael silvestre for headbutting freddie ljungberg i thought it was a horrible game in the first half and it was not much better in the second he said there is no way that should have happened in a football match after the match keane accused vieira of starting the row patrick vieira is ft in and having a go at gary neville so i said have a go at me he said if he wants to intimidate our players and thinks that gary neville is an easy target im not having it manchester united manager sir alex ferguson added vieira was well wound up for it ive heard different stories patrick vieira has apparently threatened some of our players and things like that bellamy under new fire newcastle boss graeme souness has reopened his dispute with craig bellamy after claiming the welshman was not good enough for the magpies bellamy left newcastle to join celtic on loan after a major row with souness souness who refused to refer to the yearold by name said bellamy did not score enough goals the chap thats just gone has scored goals a season in his time in senior football half of those werent even in the top flight said souness thats not good enough for a striker at a club like this we need to have two strikers who are near goals on a regular basis bellamy turned down a move to birmingham in favour of joining celtic after a disagreement about the welsh international playing out of position quickly escalated earlier in the week souness had said that he risked losing the confidence of the players and damaging his own reputation if he had not taken a hard line after bellamy accused him of lying there are certain things you can forgive and forget said souness but if id been seen to be weak in this case there was no future for me with the players in the dressing room or any job i have after newcastle he could then return to st james park and he says that he wants to however it would seem unlikely he will play for newcastle again as long as souness remains in charge chelsea denied by james heroics a brave defensive display led by keeper david james helped manchester city hold the leaders chelsea after a quiet opening james denied damien duff jiri jarosik and mateja kezman while paul bosvelt cleared william gallas header off the line robbie fowler should have scored for the visitors but sent his header wide chelsea had most of the possession in the second half but james kept out frank lampards freekick and superbly tipped the same players volley wide city went into the game with the proud record of being the only domestic team to beat chelsea this season and there was little to alarm them in the first minutes as chelsea deprived of arjen robben and didier drogba through injury struggled to pose much of a threat indeed it was the visitors who looked likelier to enliven a drab opening played at a lethargic pace shaun wrightphillips watched by england boss svengoran eriksson showed his customary trickery to burst into the right of the area and deliver a dangerous ball which was

wide soon afterwards jarosik found space in the area to powerfully head lampards corner goalwards but james tipped the ball over chelsea were now looking more like premiership leaders and james kept out kezmans fierce drive before bosvelt and james combined to clear gallas header from duffs corner city broke swiftly up the field and the last chance of a frenetic spell should have resulted in fowler celebrating his th premiership goal wrightphillips raced down the left and crossed to fowler but citys lone man up front left free by terrys slip contrived to head wide when it seemed a breakthrough was certain the second half started as quietly as the first although james was forced to divert a cross from the lively duff away from eidur gudjohnsens path there was a nasty moment for petr cech looking for a ninth straight clean sheet in the league when a series of ricochets saw fowler chase a loose ball in the area and collide accidently with the czech republic stopper another quiet spell followed which duff interrupted with a surging run that was halted illegally on the edge of the penalty area by bosvelt lampard stepped up to blast a shot through the wall and james somehow blocked it with his legs another timely challenge this time from richard dunne in time added on prevented gudjohnsen from getting in a shot there was still time for james to produce a

chelsea ridiculed over complaint barcelona assistant coach henk ten cate has branded chelseas expected complaint to uefa as pathetic the blues are poised to complain about an alleged halftime incident during wednesdays loss at the nou camp the source of chelseas anger was an alleged talk between barca boss frank rijkaard and referee anders frisk who later dismissed didier drogba to react the way chelsea have is pathetic mourinho lied with the lineups and now this ten cate said uefa has said its own tunnel representative witnessed nothing unusual out of the ordinary during the halftime break spokesman william gaillard said frisk says rijkaard greeted him and apologised he had not had the opportunity to say hello before the game we had two uefa officials there and neither witnessed it the referees dressing room was locked and he and his assistants were the only people allowed in indeed it is the londoners who could be on the receiving end of any punishment after failing to turn up for the compulsory press conference after the defeat uefa delegate thomas giordano added the only unusual thing that happened as far as we are concerned is that chelsea failed to present themselves in the press conference the referee is not expected to include any of the alleged incidents in his report to uefa weakening chelseas case rijkaard was critical of mourinhos decision not to speak to the media after the match there was a lot of talking before the game and now surprisingly there is a lot of talking after the game it is not good behaviour after a match he said maybe they want to start something and make it worse than than it is i really dont understand it i am very calm about it barca midfielder deco formerly managed by mourinho at porto agreed that it was not typical of his fellow portuguese to lodge a protest its not normal behaviour on his part it was not logical he did not give a news conference he said rijkaard added chelsea is the team which has conceded fewest goals in the english league and they defend very well so i am very pleased with the win my men deserved victory and i am pleased to have won this match i congratulate my players owen determined to stay in madrid england forward michael owen has told the bbc he is happy in spain and has no plans to quit real madrid to return to the premiership in the near future but the yearold who has spent much of his time coming off the bench in la liga did not rule out a return to the premiership at some stage im pleased with the start ive made here he told bbc radio five live england is my country its definitely part of me but who knows whether if or when ill be playing there again owen who moved to the bernabeu from liverpool last summer has grabbed goals for real but has been unable to replace raul or ronaldo in the starting lineup however he said he was delighted with the way his time in spain was going and dismissed criticism of his decision to join real when i first came there was a lot of scepticism back in england any maybe some out here he said people were saying fourthchoice striker what are you going there for youll be sat on the bench all the time but as much as our press like to build it up as if ive permanently had my backside on the bench ive played as many games as anyone else in the team this year for a fourthchoice striker at the start im more than happy with the way ive settled in recent speculation has linked owen with a move back to england with newcastle expressing their interest but the england striker said he is not ready to return home he added ive got nothing against the premiership i mean thats where i first performed thats where i made my name i cant keep my eyes off the premiership on television when im at home when asked if it would have to be liverpool if he returned owen said ive not really given it much thought ive got great memories of liverpool no matter what happens itll always be a club i have fond memories of and it will always have a place in my heart its very flattering to be linked to top clubs in england im glad that noone is forgetting me but i couldnt have wished for a better start in madrid listen to the full interview with garry richardson on bbc radio five lives sportsweek at gmt on sunday downing injury mars uefa victory middlesbrough boss steve mcclaren hopes that stewart downing did not seriously damage his hamstring during the uefa cup win over graz ak the winger was carried off on a stretcher in the closing stages as boro booked their place in the last mcclaren said stewart has tweaked a hamstring which is a blow for us we will assess it in the morning but im delighted with the match result they say in sport you can win ugly and we certainly did mcclaren was relieved to make it through after a tough encounter at the riverside to be fair to graz they had a gameplan they knocked the ball forward especially in the first half and we struggled to deal with it in the second half we were better but it was frustrating because we got the goal but one slip and they were back in it boro face sporting lisbon for a place in the quarterfinals after the portuguese side saw off feyenoord on thursday and mcclaren added sporting are technically very good portuguese sides always are but the journey goes on for us and we will now go to their magnificent stadium after the first game here well look forward to it goalscorer jimmy floyd hasselbaink added it wasnt a particularly beautiful match to watch but they made it difficult for us we didnt play well at all but you need a little bit of luck and i think we got that when my shot went through the legs of their goalkeeper i would have liked to play in holland that would have been a little bit special to me but so is going back to portugal ill be playing against some lads i played with at boavista rangers seal old firm win goals from gregory vignal and nacho novo gave rangers a scrappy victory at celtic park that moves them three points clear of the champions rangers had rarely threatened until celtic goalkeeper rab douglas let defender vignals yard drive slip through his grasp and into the net opposite number ronald waterreus had been rangers hero saving superbly from craig bellamy and john hartson striker novo secured victory lobbing douglas with eight minutes remaining it ended celtics game unbeaten run at home in old firm derbies and gave rangers manager alex mcleish his first victory at the home of his glasgow rivals celtic had won their last six meetings on their home pitch including twice already this season they started confidently with new signing bellamy on loan from newcastle united given his celtic debut up front with wales international colleague john hartson and chris sutton dropping into midfield it took bellamy just four minutes to threaten taking on marvin andrews before delivering a low drive that was held by waterreus at the second attempt he had an even better chance after hartson dispossesed sotiris kyrgiakos and sent his strike partner clear with only the goalkeeper to beat but waterreus did well to beat away bellamys disappointing low drive from yards waterreus came to the rescue again when the ball fell to hartson just inside the box and the dutch goalkeeper made a brave block it was an old firm return for barry ferguson as mcleish stuck by the side that thumped four goals past hibernian but rangers found celtic harder to break down and douglas was not threatened until minutes after the break dado prso turned inside neil lennon only for the celtic goalkeeper to beat away his powerful yard drive a great defensive header by andrews prevented hartson pouncing from five yards out hartson foxed vignal at the edge of the rangers box but the strikers shot on the turn was again beaten away by waterreus rangers were beginning to dominate the midfield and vignal collecting a knock back from fernando ricksen broke the deadlock douglas somehow letting the frenchmans dipping drive slip through his grasp novo pounced on a moments hesitation in the celtic defence to latch on to a long ball from ricksen and lob the ball over the advancing douglas ricksen appeared to be hit by a coin but it could not prevent rangers celebrations at the final whistle douglas mcnamara balde varga laursen petrov lennon sutton thompson bellamy hartson subs marshall henchoz

mccurry sfa awaits report over mikoliunas the scottish football association is awaiting referee hugh dallass report before acting against hearts winger saulius mikoliunas mikoliunas barged linesman andy davis who had advised dallas to award rangers an injurytime penalty in heartss defeat at tynecastle he was sent off for violent conduct in the th minute but we dont know if he did something else after the whistle we dont know how many red cards he was shown said an sfa statement hearts could also face action after three fans were arrested for throwing coins on the pitch rangers striker dad prso was also sent off during the same incident when he received a second yellow card for wrestling the ball away from craig gordon and leaving the hearts keeper on the ground the sfa said once the referees report comes in then well immediately look at things we dont normally get the reports until a couple of days after the game but were well aware of what happened here prso was sent off for two cautions and that will just be a onematch suspension the sfa is certain to come down hard on mikoliunas after southamptons david prutton was banned for games on wednesday by the english fa for shoving referee alan wiley hearts boss john robertson said mikoliunas has thrown his chest against the assistant referees chest and got a red card for it the officials have got to take into account the fact hes a young lad but people have got to take into account why he was incensed why were hearts fans incensed why did nobody from the rangers bench claim for a penalty kick rangers boss alex mcleish accepted referee dallas had no option but to send prso off mcleish said im glad to see the spirit of the players fighting to the very end literally with dado trying to get the ball back from craig gordon but it was overzealousness and i dont think hugh had any option jol joy at professional cup win tottenham manager martin jol acclaimed his players for their patience in their fa cup fifthround victory over a determined nottingham forest side we had the initiative but it wasnt easy it was a professional sort of performance the dutchman said forest played with a lot of players behind the ball in the first half but at they were dead and buried looking ahead to the quarterfinal jol said newcastle have got a very good side and they are always difficult however he added that his side who are four places above the magpies in the premiership were not afraid of anyone robbie keane skipper for the night and scorer of the crucial second goal echoed his managers sentiments on the lasteight match theyre on a high but were confident and in the last few games weve played well and hopefully we can go there and get the win he said he conceded the win over forest which included goals from noe pamarot and mido was not pretty to watch it wasnt the best display but its all about the result the irishman said we knew it was going to be difficult with the conditions the pitch wasnt the best but we still tried to pass it we dug in and the gaffer said to us at halftime to keep being patient and that the goal will come forest manager gary megson conceded his team did not deserve anything after a poor performance if you play like we did and concede two goals from corners youre going to have an uphill battle against a very good team he said if we defend in the championship like we did well not get another point we were organised but i felt at times we thought the system would be enough but we didnt look like scoring owen delighted with real display michael owen revelled in his return to the to the real madrid starting lineup and inspired a win over real betis on wednesday by scoring the first goal he said i am happy i could play a game from the start again i felt good all though the game and it is obvious that i am happy to have scored another goal people have talked a lot about my performances and i think i have had some months that were not so good and others that were very good owen starting his third successive la liga match converted a low cross from santiago solari robert carlos made it at the break smashing home an indirect freekick midfielder edu reduced the deficit after halftime but ivan helguera headed past keeper antonio doblas to seal victory for his team victory took real to within six points of leaders barcelona and owen is confident real can close the gap he added we had several chances against betis and i think we can get back in touch with barcelona it is only six points between barcelona and us and that is nothing if we can beat them at the bernabeu on april then it will be just three owen has scored nine league goals one behind reals top scorer ronaldo real had lost their previous two league games rush future at chester uncertain ian rushs future as chester manager is uncertain after he and assistant mark aizlewood refused a severance package chester have won only two of their last league games but chairman steve vaughan claims he cannot afford to sack the yearold liverpool legend vaughan said i offered a financial settlement so they could resign with dignity but an obvious action is to dismiss them i havent because of the finances so technically theyre still employees vaughan claimed that aizlewood had verbally agreed to the offer but the chester chairman added after they discussed the offer with their solicitor who also acts as their agent they decided to withdraw the verbal agreement which was disappointing rush was appointed at the end of august following the departure of former liverpool teammate mark wright who guided chester to the conference title last season chester were bottom of league two when rush took over but the former liverpool striker enjoyed an impressive start to managerial life taking the club into the third round of the fa cup and winning the managerofthemonth award for october chesters downturn in form culminated in a defeat at shrewsbury that leaves them hovering just above the league two relegation zone reyes tricked into real admission jose antonio reyes has added to speculation linking him with a move from arsenal to real madrid after falling victim to a radio prank the spaniard believed he was talking to real madrid sporting director emilio butragueno when he allegedly berated his teammates as bad people i wish i was playing for real madrid the yearold told cadena cope hopefully it could happen i love the way madrid play im not happy with the way things are the striker joined the gunners from seville for m at the start of but it has frequently been reported that he is homesick he began the season in superb form but has struggled to maintain his high standards as arsenal have gradually lost the premiership initiative to manchester united and chelsea if im not playing for real im going to have to carry on playing with some bad people he added im sure there are none in the real dressing room im happy madrid is interested in me because it has always been my dream since i was little to play there before the story surfaced reyes had moved to play down reports linking him with the spanish giants issuing a statement through arsenal describing the speculation as flattering i have seen the stories in the media linking me with real madrid he had said on thursday lunchtime but not only am i under contract at arsenal i am happy here and committed to helping the team win more trophies butragueno meanwhile was angry at being impersonated by the radio disc jockey it is a disgrace there is no foundation to this he said he is an arsenal player and we have to be respectful we have to be careful because of the rumours that appear in the news wenger dejected as arsenal slump arsenal manager arsene wenger claimed their display in the defeat against bayern munich was our worst peformance in the champions league kolo toures late goal gives the gunners hope for the second leg but wenger said the only positive is that we are still in the tie the players are really down in the dressingroom i feel we really turned in a bad performance at we faced a real struggle but at least gives us a chance goalscorer toure was also at fault for two goals and wenger said we need to help toure rebuild his confidence as he is low at the moment wenger also tried to stay upbeat himself adding but there is enough time for crying i could cry maybe it would be easier but life goes on in this job you have good and bad nights this was a bad night but i still have confidence in the quality of my players as well as their spirit and desire but wengers bayern counterpart felix magath was in no mood to celebrate either he said i am far from happy despite the win my players failed to try and score a fourth to kill the tie and then conceded the late goal arsenal are fully capable of scoring several goals against us on their own turf arsenal keeper jens lehmann whose personal rivalry with bayern goalkeeper oliver kahn was not helped by the result said do i blame myself for the third goal as a goalkeeper i always blame myself i just know the goals were very easy against us in my time here we have never conceded three easy goals like that but sometimes it happens it would have been impossible to go through at but with the goal we have chances everything is now possible mourinho defiant on chelsea form chelsea boss jose mourinho has insisted that sir alex ferguson and arsene wenger would swap places with him mourinhos side were knocked out of the fa cup by newcastle last sunday before seeing barcelona secure a champions league firstleg lead in the nou camp but he denied his club was suffering a dip in form which league rivals arsenal and manchester united could exploit they cannot speak to us about blips because theyre not in a better position than us mourinho said do they want to change positions with us we are top of the league by nine points and in the carling cup final the only thing they can say they are in a better position than us in is the fa cup in the champions league all three teams can either go through or go out but the one team that is in the best position is still chelsea mourinho said it was important to keep his teams results in perspective dont try to put pressure on me because i am never under pressure he warned we have lost one important game this week at newcastle and were out of the fa cup but i dont think a defeat in a firstleg tie is a real defeat we are just down at halftime asked if his chelsea honeymoon was now over mourinho replied i have had years of honeymoons with my wife the day that this club is not happy with me is the day that i go hodgson relishes european clashes former blackburn boss roy hodgson says the premiership should follow the rest of europe and have a winter break but insists that a gruelling domestic schedule will not damage the english elites bid for champions league glory hodgson now in charge at viking stavanger was at liverpools clash with bayer leverkusen at anfield on tuesday as a member of uefas technical committee hodgson is a fierce advocate of the winter break employed throughout europe although not in england where the champions league contenders have ploughed through a heavy fixture list but hodgson told bbc sport that while he believes the premiership should embrace the idea he does not expect it to cost the english representatives in the last of the champions league i just feel it is very difficult to say with certainty that teams who have had the break will have a definite edge i am a fervent supporter of the break it gives players the chance to recharge their batteries midway through the season which some suggest will give teams an advantage in the champions league the other school of thought suggests having a break then coming back to it puts you at a disadvantage the bigger discussions around the winter break should be to do with the nature of football today the needs of football players and the way the premiership has developed rather than one or two matches in the champions league in february hodgson believes a winter break carries many advantages explaining as i said it is the perfect chance to recharge batteries and certainly if i was still a manager in england i would be supporting any calls for its introduction in preseason you get a lot of enthusiasm and energy but by the time you get towards christmas many players having also played plenty of international matches for club and country and travelled a lot find themselves getting very jaded the break gives them a chance to recover that energy and enthusiasm and perhaps more importantly recover their mental strength during the break and get ready for the games ahead the mental side is by far the most important thing hodgson added the length of breaks can vary in italy the break was very short you just took christmas and new year it was so short you didnt do anything you gave the players a week or days off then you were training for a week or days and then went into a game if it is longer it is important those responsible for physical fitness give the players a programme to follow to ensure the physical strength they have accumulated stays with them and hodgson believes a winter break would be a positive step in the premiership he said if we talk about football at elite level which the premiership is then i would support a winter break if you examine the demands of the premier league and in particular on players who play international football for their club and country then a break would do them

wasted chances for the underdogs but paddy kenny was inspired to keep arsenal at bay arsenal stripped of attacking talent such as thierry henry and dennis bergkamp partnered yearold italian striker arturo lupoli with ljungberg up front it was a revamped arsenal lineup and they were almost a goal behind within seconds as tonge wasted a glorious chance gray ran free down the right flank and his cross left tonge with the simplest of chances but he blazed over the top from six yards arsenal were barely seen as an attacking force in the opening minutes although ljungberg turned a halfchance wide after good work by cesc fabregas arsene wenger introduced quincy owusuabeyie for the ineffective lupoli at halftime and the pacy dutch youngster had an immediate impact he ran clear after good work by mathieu flamini but his finish was tame and kenny saved easily owusuabeyie then fired in a testing cross which was met by fabregas and it needed a desperate clearance by kennys legs to save the blades arsenal were now totally dominant and were desperately unlucky not to take the lead after minutes when fabregas crashed a rising drive against the bar from yards it then took a brilliant tackle by jagielka to deny ljungberg as he was poised to strike arsenal continued to press and once again kenny was called into action with eight minutes left diving low to clutch another closerange

dutch league and offensive and distinctive football we need to find a solution soon so someone is in place for next season ronald koeman quit as ajax boss last week after their exit from the uefa cup

cup final baros who is liverpools leading scorer this season denied reports of a row with benitez but claims he is mystified at being left on the bench he told czech newspaper daily sport i dont know why i didnt play on sunday i didnt argue with anybody i was disappointed but i am not thinking of leaving right now the czech international came on as a substitute after minutes but could not prevent his side losing to chelsea after extratime baros denied suggestions he wanted to leave the millennium stadium before the match upon learning of his omission from the starting lineup but his admission that he guessed something like this was going to happen on saturday will do little to quell claims of a fallingout with benitez and although baros insisted thoughts of quitting anfield are not in my mind right now he admitted everything is possible prutton poised for lengthy fa ban southamptons david prutton faces a possible sevenmatch ban when he goes before the football association the yearold has admitted two charges of improper conduct following his dismissal against arsenal the first charge relates to his failure to leave the field promptly pushing referee alan wiley and remonstrating with assistant referee paul norman and the second charge is for using threatening words andor behaviour to a match official during the draw paolo di canio was given a sevenmatch suspension when he pushed referee paul alcock over in a premiership game between sheffield wednesday and arsenal in prutton will be joined at wednesdays hearing by saints boss harry redknapp who believes that the fa will throw the book at his player redknapp himself sprinted along the touchline to help physio jim joyce and coach denis rofe shepherd the enraged prutton away from referees assistant norman david has made a big mistake and he knows it i cant condone what hes done he was out of order but he knows that said redknapp hes a decent lad he overreacted badly for some reason he had a rush of blood from somewhere off the pitch you couldnt meet a nicer lad prutton has apologised publicly for his actions and to arsenals robert pires who was injured in a wild tackle by the saints midfield man he said its an horrendous situation i apologise to the ref and linesman who were only doing their job ive also seen what happened to pires leg and im sorry for that as well i apologise for the people who saw it i know you get lots of kids going to the match now and they dont pay money to see that sort of thing its not a copout but it was all a bit of a blur sometimes you react and its beyond your control added prutton robben plays down european return injured chelsea winger arjen robben has insisted that he only has a chance of making a return against barcelona in the champions league the yearold has been sidelined since breaking a foot against blackburn last month chelsea face barcelona at home on march having lost in the first leg and robben told the daily star it is not impossible that i will play against barcelona but it is just a very very small chance about robben has been an inspirational player for chelsea this season following a switch from psv einhoven last summer he added my recovery is going better than we expected a few weeks ago but i think the barcelona game will come too soon i wont take any risks and come back too soon adrianos chelsea link rejected adrianos agent gilmar rinaldi has insisted that he has had no contact with chelsea over the striker chelsea were reported to have made inquiries about inter milans yearold brazilian star rinaldi told bbc sport from rio de janeiro i can assure you that chelsea have had no dealings whatsoever with either me or adriano parma and real madrid are interested but theres nothing new there their interest has been known for some time adriano has scored goals in serie a appearances this season and chelsea boss jose mourinho had claimed that he was in milan talking to adriano on the day he is alleged to have held a clandestine meeting with arsenal defender ashley cole mourinho said he was just practising my portuguese with him because i dont need strikers rinaldi told bbc sport i have to say that nobody from chelsea or any other london club has contacted me if they want to thats fine i can tell them what the situation is if chelsea are interested then they must make an offer inter are reported to have slapped a price tag in the region of m on the head of adriano who joined them just over a year ago from parma real madrid view him as a natural replacement for compatriot ronaldo but rinaldi said i cannot give you a price that inter would accept for adriano thats something that would have to be negotiated between the interested clubs fa decides not to punish mourinho the football association will take no action against chelsea boss jose mourinho following his sendingoff in sundays carling cup final mourinho who was sent from the touchline for appearing to taunt liverpool fans has been reminded of his responsibilities to the game but the fa confirmed there will be no further action taken in this matter mourinho claimed his silence gesture was aimed at the media although they were on the other side of the ground the former porto coach was forced to watch the climax of his sides victory over liverpool on television after being ushered away from the touchline by fourth official phil crossley his gesture came after chelseas equaliser on minutes courtesy of a steven gerrard own goal mourinho still faces an fa investigation into his allegation that manchester uniteds players cheated during januarys carling cup semifinal at stamford bridge and uefa could also launch disciplinary action following mourinhos failure to attend a compulsory postmatch press conference after chelseas champions league defeat at barcelona last week in addition some time this month chelsea must also answer a charge of failing to control their players during the premiership win at blackburn in february and a charge of failing to control their supporters following a carling cup meeting with west ham earlier this season is still to be heard the premier league is also continuing investigations into allegations chelsea officials tapped up arsenal defender ashley cole in january aragones angered by racism fine spain coach luis aragones is furious after being fined by the spanish football federation for his comments about thierry henry the yearold criticised his euros punishment even though it was far below the maximum penalty i am not guilty nor do i accept being judged for actions against the image of the sport he said im not a racist and ive never lacked sporting decorum ive never done that and i have medals for sporting merit aragones was handed the fine on tuesday after making racist remarks about henry to arsenal teammate and spanish international jose reyes last october the spanish football federation at first declined to take action against aragones but was then requested to do so by spains antiviolence commission the fine was far less than the expected amount of about or even the suspension of his coaching licence arsenal boss arsene wenger who was fined in december for accusing manchester united striker ruud van nistelrooy of cheating believes that aragones punishment was too lenient you compare his fine and my fine and if you consider his was for racist abuse then you seem to get away with it more in spain than you should wenger said he shouldnt have said what he said and how much money is enough i dont know but it doesnt look a big punishment however aragones insists the fine is unjustified and unfair i have been treated like islero the bull that killed famous bullfighter manolete said aragones on hearing he had been fined for his actions i have not liked one thing about this whole affair and i do not agree with the sanction they have looked for a scapegoat spains antiviolence commission must now ratify the spanish fas decision and has until next week to announce its verdict aragones has days to appeal and the commission can also appeal alberto flores president of the spanish fas disciplinary committee said noone in the committee felt aragones was a racist nor had acted in a racist way a fine the highest we could apply is sufficient punishment suspension would have been a bit exaggerated flores told sports daily marca boro

everton spokesman ian ross he added he did speak to the police but will not be pressing charges he has spoken to manager david moyes about what happened beattie was suspended for the win at aston villa after his red card against chelsea and he will be available again for the merseyside derby at liverpool on march keegan hails comeback king fowler manchester city boss kevin keegan has praised striker robbie fowler for his landmark return to form the yearold out of favour at city earlier this season took his premiership goal tally past with a brace in mondays win at norwich he is still a quality player and knows where the net is we have just got to supply him with ammunition and in the end we did keegan said he has worked hard to get back to where he is now the former liverpool striker who moved to city in after a poor stint at leeds has battled back into firstteam contention after struggling with fitness at the start of the season fowler overtook les ferdinand on tuesday evening to become the third highest scorer of all time in the premiership with goals and he only trails alan shearer and andy cole and keegan believes there is still more to come from the former england forward he can get better if we can supply him better added keegan people want to write him off but if he has kept the articles of those people who have written him off he could throw them back at them and they would be left with a bit of egg on their face fowlers double strike helped city come back from two goals down to clinch a dramatic win at carrow road and keegan sympathised with norwich boss nigel worthington afterwards i feel a bit for nigel worthington he said his team have got great character they have a lot of drive and enthusiasm i know it is a killer blow for norwich but i really think they have brought something to the premiership the stadium and the atmosphere is great it is just a tough league to stay in as they are finding out and as we know cole refuses to blame van persie ashley cole has refused to blame robin van persie for leaving arsenal with no fullyfit strikers for the fa cup fifth round replay at sheffield united van persie is suspended alongside dennis bergkamp and jose antonio reyes after being sent off at southampton when arsenal had a numerical advantage thierry henry is ruled out with an achilles tendon injury but cole said noone is putting the blame on robin its just something that happens on the spur of the moment cole added ive done it before and i hope they didnt blame me for anything of course hell learn ive been sent off a couple of times now and its just one of those things when you go a bit crazy for one or two seconds freddie ljungberg is likely to be used in an emergency striking role and will be partnered by either arturo lupoli quincy owusuabeyie or jeremie aliadiere gunners boss arsene wenger said freddie is an option but we need a second striker i have to decide whether it will be aliadiere quincy or lupoli who will start with him up front those three will be involved arsenal are also without winger robert pires who sustained an ankle injury at st marys wenger added it doesnt look like anything is fractured but it is a good ankle sprain it does not look like pires will be ready for two to three weeks blackburn v burnley ewood park tuesday march gmt howard webb south yorkshire home to leicester in the quarterfinals but defender andy todd is suspended and could be replaced by dominic matteo if he recovers from a hamstring injury burnley have major injury concerns over frank sinclair and john mcgreal michael duff looks set to continue at rightback with john oster in midfield and micah hyde is expected to recover from a knee injury blackburn boss mark hughes burnley are resolute and have individual talent but i fully expect us to progress i thought we were comfortable in the first game and never thought we were under pressure its a competition we want to progress in and we are doing okay if we beat burnley we have a home tie against another lower league club leicester burnley boss steve cotterill they will be fresh and well be tired that is an honest opinion but our lads just might be able to get themselves up for one more big game the atmosphere at the last game was very hot a good verbal contest our fans will not need whipping up for this game i just want them to help us as much as they can in a positive way key match stats blackburn rovers against bolton is part two of an east lancashire hotpot that didnt turn out to be that spicy when first staged on a sunday lunchtime the weekend before last and resulted in a scrappy goalless draw rovers who are aiming to win the cup for a seventh time in their history and first time in years face another replay against championship opposition after eventually disposing of cardiff at ewood park in the third round but theyve not been beaten in the competition by a club outside the premiership for nine years since ipswich then in the second tier defeated them after extra time in a third round replay at ewood park on january history is on rovers side when they last met their near neighbours in the fa cup years ago it also required an ewood park replay which the home side won and when they last met in the league rovers did the double they first won their nationwide division one trip to turf moor four seasons ago and then thrashed the clarets on home soil manager mark hughes who won the cup four times as a player is aiming to steer rovers into the quarterfinals for the second time in years and first time since the season success here and victory home to leicester in the next round could see rovers in the semifinals without having played premiership opposition burnley make the eight mile journey to their fierce rivals determined to send blackburn the same way as liverpool in the third round but having failed to pull off another shock at turf moor it could be that the championship outfit places inferior on the league ladder have missed their best opportunity having said that burnley are yet to concede a goal in this cup run steve cotterills clarets have been knocked out in the fifth round four times in the last seven years and have made only one appearance in the sixth round in years that was in the season before last when they disposed of premiership fulham at this fifth round stage while blackburn have not played since the fifth round tie burnley have had two league outings away from home drawing at derby and losing at preston that takes their winless run to four games the combatants from onetime prosperous mill towns are both founder members of the football league head to head th prem winners six times th championship winners once brentford v southampton griffin park tuesday march gmt barry knight kent home to manchester united in the quarterfinals midfielder andrew frampton and striker deon burton are both slight doubts with hamstring injuries but should be fit saints are missing their entire firstchoice midfield of jamie redknapp graeme le saux nigel quashie and david prutton anders svensson and matt oakley are likely replacements with kevin phillips also scheduled to start with henri camara rested brentford boss martin allen after conceding eight goals in our last three matches i have to admit im not very confident theres no doubt were the underdogs and after defending so poorly recently its not looking good southampton have just drawn with the premiership champions and that makes our task harder than it was already southampton boss harry redknapp we know they can give us problems brentford have done well but we are the premiership side and should have the better players staying in the premiership is our priority we want to win of course we do well battle but if it comes to a football match i think well win key match stats brentford are the lowest ranked club left in the fa cup theyre on their best run in the competition since reaching the quarterfinals for the fourth time in their history years ago now they have the carrot of the plum draw in the last eight dangling before them victory over premiership strugglers southampton would bring the mighty manchester united to griffin park and a gigantic pay day for the sole league one survivors martin allens brave side came back from two goals down at st marys to earn a deserved replay southampton striker henri camara scored twice from close range to put the saints in command but isaiah rankin hit back just before half time and sam sodje headed past a creaky defence on minutes the londoners have conceded six goals in their two subsequent league outings three each in losing away to hartlepool and drawing at home to sheffield wednesday but they havent lost in six league and cup games on home turf winning three and drawing three since the reverse to torquay on boxing day southampton go into this tie on the back of an eventful premiership match with arsenal on saturday an angry david prutton pushed referee alan wiley after being shown the red card but his side still came back to draw it was saints fourth stalemate in succession in all competitions but didnt lift them out of the relegation zone the retention of their ever present premier league status must be the number one priority irrespective of the rewards that success against brentford would bring victory here would set up a repeat of the final when saints astounded the football world by defeating tommy dochertys manchester united courtesy of bobby stokes famous winner they also knocked out the red devils in on penalties in the fourth round but to write another chapter in their fa cup history the solent side must avoid succumbing to lower division opposition for the first time since rotherham from the second level beat them in a third round tie at millmoor on january southampton were last humbled by a club from the third tier six years ago fulham were then in the second division when they won a third round replay at craven cottage on january to get to within two matches of a second visit to the millennium stadium in three years for the final harry redknapp

mourinho expects fight to finish chelsea manager jose mourinho expects the champions league clash with barcelona to be a fight to the finish mourinho is relishing the first leg of the tie against his former club in the last in the nou camp he said i wouldnt be surprised if nothing had been decided by the last minute of the return leg and the match had to go into extra time i have to defend what is mine and the champions league is mine at the moment im the last manager to have won it mourinho never coached barcelona assisting both sir bobby robson and louis van gaal but he is not envious insisting i dont have to be jealous about barcelona because they have years of history and have won the european cup once i have been managing for five years and i have the same amount of champions league trophies to my name barcelona star ronaldinho admitted i think that it is going to be a difficult match for us because chelsea have a good team full of big stars i have seen chelsea a few times on television tactically they are very good and they are very strong on the counterattack they pressure very well and keep possession of the ball so it will be important that we play our own game i believe they are the two strongest teams in europe nevertheless barcelona are accustomed to playing big games at the nou camp where they have to face the likes of real madrid each season it is a special game the atmosphere in the city changes there are lots of journalists but inside the dressing room there is not a lot of difference ronaldinho added we are only thinking of winning the match

bolton i have signed a fivemonth contract with bolton said candela who will travel to england on tuesday in june i will decide whether to continue to play for bolton or retire from professional football allardyce hopes candelas arrival will relieve boltons injury crisis after defender nicky hunt limped out injured during oldhams win against oldham in the fa cup on sunday in light of what has happened to nicky hunt with his injury it might be a blessing in disguise that we can bring in a highlyexperienced fullback to help with our injuries at the back allardyce said he has an outstanding pedigree in the game and has won honours at the highest level including the world cup in he has not played regular football this year but is eager to impress in the premiership he can play in any position at the back and despite him being predominately rightfooted he has played the majority of his career at leftback candela who was a member of the roma side that won the title in has made only seven league appearances this season for luigi del neris side stuart joins norwich from addicks norwich have signed charlton midfielder graham stuart until the end of the season for an undisclosed fee

will be joining us until the end of the season hes gives us a wealth of experience hopefully he can be part of keeping us in the premier league stuart has extensive topflight experience with everton chelsea and charlton and can play across the midfield positions he joins norwich with the norfolk club secondfrombottom in the premiership but stuart is confident that the carrow road outfit have a bright future ive been very impressed with the facilities here its obviously a very well run football club with excellent facilities and ive always enjoyed playing at carrow road he added its a nice compact ground with a good atmosphere and hopefully i can help give the fans something else to cheer stuart a former england under international made appearances for chelsea scoring goals before joining everton he won the fa cup with the toffees in and remains a hero at goodison park after his stminute winner against wimbledon saved everton from relegation in stuart spent just over four years at goodison park making senior appearances and scoring goals before signing for sheffield united where he scored goals in appearances after signing for charlton he made appearances scoring times but recently he has been battling a back problem and had not played for the londoners for three months before heading to norwich campbell lifts lid on united feud arsenals sol campbell has called the rivalry between manchester united and the gunners bitter and personal past encounters have stirred up plenty of illfeeling between the sides and they meet again at highbury on tuesday it is just more bitter and personal against united the defender told the guardian newspaper theres an edge after all that has happened if we beat them it will be one of our sweetest ever wins especially because of how we lost to them up there last october arsenal lost at old trafford which ended a record match unbeaten league run and sparked a minicrisis with the gunners winning only three of their next games it had a psychological impact on us but again because of the way we were defeated added the yearold referring to a controversial penalty award for uniteds first goal that was far more upsetting losing like that because they just seem to get away with it you try and balance out over the course of a season but ive had so many rough decisions against them you begin to wonder with tensions spilling over afterwards united boss sir alex ferguson was allegedly pelted with pizza in the players tunnel there is little surprise that so much is riding on the return encounter on everyone at arsenal has been waiting for this game said campbell we are up for this one speaking on his longterm plans campbell signalled his intent to move abroad before he turns im now and in five years time i wont be in this country thats definite italy looks good to me because it would suit my kind of football spain is an option but the idea of tasting a new culture and learning another language excites me the most

yearolds contract expires in the summer but real want a quick deal sivabaek added i will be meeting real on wednesday there is serious interest but it is evertons hands everton must decide whether to cash in now on the denmark midfield man or risk losing him for nothing in the summer manager david moyes has defiantly claimed that he expects gravesen to still be at everton when the transfer window closes at the end of january moyes said i speak to tommy regularly and we know where we are at theres been no contact we dont want to lose him real madrid general manager arrigo sacchi is the driving force behind the move convincing vicepresident emilio butragueno and new coach wanderley luxemburgo that gravesen is the right man for the bernabeu everton must weigh up whether it is worth taking the money on offer for real and risk their own ambitions for european football gravesen has been outstanding as everton have established themselves in the premierships top four this season klinsmann issues lehmann warning germany coach jurgen klinsmann has warned goalkeeper jens lehmann he may have to quit arsenal to keep his world cup dreams alive lehmann is understudy to oliver kahn in the german squad but has lost his place to manuel alumnia at highbury klinsmann said it will be difficult for any of our players if he is not a firstchoice at his club if jens is not arsenals number one keeper that is a problem for me he must be playing regularly lehmann is desperate to keep his place in the germany squad when the country hosts the world cup in klinsmann added if he is not playing regularly he cannot be germanys number one keeper or even number two keeper the situation for jens is that he is currently the number two keeper at arsenal this could be critical if it remains the same during next season wenger signs new deal arsenal manager arsene wenger has signed a new contract to stay at the club until may wenger has ended speculation about his future by agreeing a longterm contract that takes him beyond the opening of arsenals new stadium in two years he said signing a new contract just rubberstamps my desire to take this club forward and fulfil my ambitions i still

this club and am very happy here wenger has won the title and the fa cup three times each during his reign chairman peter hillwood said we are absolutely delighted that arsene has signed an extension to his contract since his arrival in he has revolutionised the club both on and off the pitch as well as the six major honours hes won during his time here arsene has been a leading influence behind all the major initiatives at the club including the construction of our new training centre and also our new stadium the club has continued to reap the benefits of arsenes natural eye for unearthing footballing talent we currently have a fantastic crop of young players coming through the ranks together with a number of worldclass players who are playing a wonderful brand of football meanwhile arsenal director danny fiszman is looking for wenger to stay beyond when we come towards the end of his contract we will both review the situation im sure we will want him to stay on and i hope he will too said fiszman fa probes crowd trouble the fa is to take action after trouble marred wednesdays carling cup tie between chelsea and west ham police in riot gear were confronted by a section of the west ham support after the match which the blues won mateja kezman the scorer of chelseas goal needed treatment on a head injury during the match after being hit by a missile believed to be a coin a spokeswoman for chelsea said the club would await the referees report before deciding on its course of action kezman was forced off the field to receive treatment on a cut above his eye but was able to continue chelsea assistant boss steve clarke said i would rather talk about the football but we think it was something thrown from the crowd he did not require stitches west ham boss alan pardew said its a shame because i thought there was good english banter in the crowd theres big rivalry between the two clubs and it is a shame if thats happened from where i was standing i didnt see any trouble former hammers star joe cole also had a plastic bottle thrown at him while frank lampard was pelted with coins as he was preparing to take a penalty lampards spotkick was saved to the delight of the hammers fans who have still not forgiven him for leaving upton park the fa will seek reports from the clubs and the police and will review video evidence and the referees report police in riot gear battled with west ham fans in the matthew harding stand and at least one supporter required treatment fans are also thought to have clashed outside the ground after the game scotland yard said there had been arrests for alleged public order drugs and offensive weapon offences the fa is already looking into the trouble at tuesdays heated carling cup tie between millwall and liverpool edu describes tunnel fracas arsenals edu has lifted the lid on the scenes that followed manchester uniteds win over the gunners the brazilian confirmed tempers had flared but could shed no light on reports that food was thrown at united boss sir alex ferguson i saw people being pulled apart people pushing pointing and shouting he told uefas official website the united players were trying to wind us up about the result but i didnt see any soup being thrown at anyone however edu tried to play down the incidents adding there was nothing that i havent seen in brazilian derbies derby matches in brazil are worse i like to play in games like this with this intense rivalry but edu was highly critical of the ferocity of some of uniteds challenges during the game particularly on jose antonio reyes i think we were a lot fairer in the tackles than united he said reyes was being kicked all over the park they were beating up the boy and gary neville was tackling in such a way that he should have been sent off following the game the football association said it would look into events in the tunnel it also charged ruud van nistelrooy with serious foul play while arsenal boss arsene wenger has been asked to explain comments he made about the referee chelsea sack mutu chelsea have sacked adrian mutu after he failed a drugs test the yearold tested positive for a banned substance which he later denied was cocaine in october chelsea have decided to write off a possible transfer fee for mutu a m signing from parma last season who may face a twoyear suspension a statement from chelsea explaining the decision readwe want to make clear that chelsea has a zero tolerance policy towards drugs mutu scored six goals in his first five games after arriving at stamford bridge but his form went into decline and he was frozen out by coach jose mourinho chelseas statement added this applies to both performanceenhancing drugs or socalled recreational drugs they have no place at our club or in sport in coming to a decision on this case chelsea believed the clubs social responsibility to its fans players employees and other stakeholders in football regarding drugs was more important than the major financial considerations to the company any player who takes drugs breaches his contract with the club as well as football association rules the club totally supports the fa in strong action on all drugs cases fifas disciplinary code stipulates that a first doping offence should be followed by a sixmonth ban and the sports world governing body has reiterated their stance over mutus failed drugs test maintaining it is a matter for the domestic sporting authorities fifa is not in a position to make any comment on the matter until the english fa have informed us of their disciplinary decision and the relevant information associated with it said a fifa spokesman chelseas move won backing from drugtesting expert michelle verroken verroken a former director of drugfree sport for uk sport insists the blues were right to sack mutu and have enhanced their reputation by doing so chelsea are saying quite clearly to the rest of their players and their fans that this is a situation they are not prepared to tolerate it was a very difficult decision for them and an expensive decision for them but the terms of his contract were breached and it was the only decision they could make it is a very clear stance by chelsea and it has given a strong boost to the reputation of the club it emerged that mutu had failed a drugs test on october and although it was initially reported that the banned substance in question was cocaine the romanian international later suggested it was a substance designed to enhance sexual performance the football association has yet to act on mutus failed drugs test and refuses to discuss his case ferguson urges henry punishment sir alex ferguson has called on the football association to punish arsenals thierry henry for an incident involving gabriel heinze ferguson believes henry deliberately caught heinze on the head with his knee during uniteds controversial win the united boss said it was worse than ruud van nistelrooys foul on ashley cole for which he got a threegame ban we shall present it to the fa and see what they do the tackle on heinze was terrible he said clubs are permitted to ask the fa to examine specific incidents but information is expected to be provided within hours of the game the clash occurred moments before halftime when a freddie ljungberg challenge left heinze on the ground on the left touchline henry following the ball attempted to hurdle the argentine but his knee collided with the back of heinzes head the striker protested his innocence and referee mike riley deemed the collision accidental ferguson was also upset by arsenals overall discipline during the heated encounter between the two archrivals and praised his own sides behaviour edu produced a terrible tackle on scholes that was a potential legbreaker he said there were fouls in the game by arsenal seven on heinze five on ronaldo six by vieira and it was only his sixth foul that got him booked phil neville got booked for his first challenge i am proud of my players for the way they handled that pressure we have always been good at being gracious in defeat what happened on sunday overshadowed our achievement but then they do it all the time dont they mutu to hold talks with juventus disgraced former chelsea striker adrian mutu is to begin talks with juventus as he looks for a new club mutu will be in our clubs main stand to watch the match between juventus and fiorentina said a juventus official who declined to be named then he will meet some important people of the club he added mutu sacked by chelsea and

matches to be played on artificial pitches from the start of next season european footballs governing body made the decision at a meeting of its executive committee on wednesday uefa explained that the move follows comprehensive studies into the sporting and medical aspects of using artificial playing surfaces they can be used subject to complying with uefa quality criteria but there use will not be made obligatory luton preston queens park rangers and other clubs used to have plastic pitches during the the s but after a twoyear study uefa insists the surfaces have moved on international matches can also be played on such pitches although games at major tournaments have to be contested on grass uefa spokesman rob faulkner said people in england have bad memories of the artificial pitches of luton and qpr in the s but the latest generation are completely different and are much more like grass we have sanctioned its use from the start of next season but only as long as it is the latest generation of artificial turf and meets a whole series of standards several leading clubs from scandinavia russia and eastern europe especially those who only play champions league or uefa cup

departure striker nicolas anelka reportedly wants to leave manchester city in search of champions league football anelka is in talks over a contract extension beyond with city but is believed to fear his career will go stale if he stays at the club the news of the world reports that anelka told a french magazine i either decide to win titles or to have an easy life i think i will always choose football if a great club makes me an offer he added to win titles you need players who have the capability of doing so if we stagnate between eighth and th place its impossible to progress if i am going to score goals and not win there is a risk it is going to create a feeling of being fed up anelka has earned a reputation for being a difficult character to handle after spells at arsenal real madrid and paris st germain and he feels that is now coming back to haunt him i am in talks to sign an extension to my contract he said i am well here but the sporting aspect also comes into account playing for eighth place is good but i miss the champions league i won it with real madrid in and i need to be playing in it and i should be playing in it im not in it because of things that have happened in the past and had nothing to do with football but i dont blame anyone its a bit my fault arnesen denies rift with santini tottenham sporting director frank arnesen has denied that coach jacques santini resigned because of a clash of personalities at white hart lane there had been newspaper speculation that santini had felt undermined by arnesens role at the club it is absolutely not true arnesen told bbc radio five live there is only one thing that made him resign and that is his own personal problems he has talked to me recently and said this matter is absolutely for himself arnesen said he was unable to throw any light onto the problems that caused santini to quit after just games in charge he added jacques has never gone into exactly what it was but i trust him in that you have to accept it i think we should respect it the plan is now that over the weekend we will have talks with the board and then on monday we will clarify the situation arnesen countered criticism at the timing of the announcement coming less than hours before tottenhams premiership fixture with charlton when it comes down to personal problems i dont think we should talk about timing he said and he also denied reports that santini had been given a m payoff that is absolute nonsense he is the one who said i will go and so he went said the spurs sporting director tottenhams structure of having a sporting director working alongside a coach is based on a continental model and arnesen sees no reason why they should change it i have confidence in this structure i am confident that we have started something here in july and i still have a lot of confidence in tottenham and what we are doing he said however former spurs and england defender gary stevens said he would not be surprised if the system had caused a rift i think the problems go a lot deeper between the director of football at white hart lane and santini stevens told five live on paper they could have worked together but frank arnesen was a very creative forwardthinking and expansive player whereas i think santini was very much the opposite more a case of being organised disciplined and happy not conceding goals that sort of arrangement can work if the two people have the same principles and ideals and work very closely but it seems that has not happened tevez an argentine in brazil some years ago bernardo gandulla left boca juniors in his native argentina and headed for brazil he arrived at the vasco da gama club with considerable prestige which he failed to live up to he left an impression but not for reasons he would have wanted the only thing of note he did was to throw the ball back when it went out of play even today gandula is the term used in brazil for ballboy brazilians delighted in the failure of gandulla then and many will delight now if history is repeated another boca juniors player is coming to brazil the new maradona carlos tevez is joining corinthians for nearly m in a strong candidate for the strangest move of the year corinthians or the londonbased company who have just entered into partnership with them appear to have paid well above the odds for tevez it is particularly strange as until last week tevez was not even an especially big name in brazil where the argentine championship is not shown presumably there is some financial logic behind the move what is harder to work out is why tevez should be interested in heading north rather than across the atlantic argentinas brightest new star hit top form in august as he spearheaded the charge towards the olympic gold medal but the subsequent months have not been easy for tevez boca resigned martin palermo forcing tevez to vacate his favoured centre forward role and off the pitch he gave the press plenty to report atletico madrid gave up on him after declaring his private life to be disorganized hounded by the press tevez grew tired of his life in buenos aires so now he says that he is heading for corinthians in search of tranquillity anyone acquainted with the city of so paulo will relish the nonsense of this declaration brazils biggest city is a sprawling ugly restless metropolis once it shared with buenos aires the same melancholy air of a city of italian immigrants but that world now lies buried under skyscrapers the most turbulent place in this frenetic city is sport club corinthians it is the most passionately supported club in brazil pel scored reams of goals against them reasoning that unless he did something special the corinthians fans were capable of winning the game on their own that passion can also be turned against the team especially nowadays when the level of urban violence gives a hysterical edge to life in brazils big cities corinthians fans have invaded the dressing room or ambushed the team coach to attack the players tevez then can kiss tranquillity goodbye he can also say farewell to the copa libertadores south americas champions league corinthians have not qualified indeed he will have a long wait for a worthwhile match next years brazilian championship only gets underway at the end of april until then he will have to make do with the foolish so paulo state championship an appalling waste of his talent there will be matches in small towns on poor pitches with plenty of defenders keen to kick him all the way back to argentina like so many of the top south american players tevez has the gift of being able to surprise to feint right and go left to pass when he was expected to dribble to shoot and catch the goalkeeper unawares but his choice of destination is the biggest surprise of all edu blasts arsenal arsenals brazilian midfielder edu has hit out at the club for stalling over offering him a new contract edus deal expires next summer and he has been linked with spanish trio real madrid barcelona and valencia he told bbc sport im not sure if i want to stay or not because the club have let the situation go on this far if they had really wanted to sign they should have come up with an offer six months before indicating they wanted to sign me and thats made me think edus brother and representative amadeo fensao has previously said that arsenals current offer to the midfielder was well short of what he was seeking and edu added my brother is due to come to london on thursday there is a meeting planned for or january to sort it out with arsenal now i have a choice to stay or go i want to sort it out as soon as possible thats in the best interests of both the club and myself im going to make my decision after the meeting later this week edu is now able to begin negotiations with other clubs because fifa regulations allow players to start talks six months before their contracts expire the midfielder who broke in to the brazilian national side in admitted he had been flattered to have been linked with the three spanish giants edu said ive just heard stories from the news that the madrid president florentino perez the valencia people as well as barcelona are interested thats nice but ive never talked to them so i cant say they want me sign last month wenger said he we was hopeful edu would sign a new deal and played down suggestions that the lure of a club like real madrid would be too strong for edu edu added that he had been encouraged by wengers support for him i still have a good relationship with arsene wenger hes always said he wants me to sign jansen suffers a further setback blackburn striker matt jansen faces three weeks out after surgery to treat a cartilage problem but central defender lorenzo amoruso is moving closer to fitness following a knee operation rovers assistant manager mark bowen said matt had a small operation to trim knee cartilage its a tiny piece of work which should be a fairly quick recovery lorenzo is also jogging for the first time along with kicking a ball jansens career has been dogged by injury since a freak scooter accident two years ago he returned to firstteam action soon after mark hughes appointment as blackburn boss and marked it with a goal against portsmouth in his first appearance of the season bowen added im guessing but i reckon maybe two to three weeks before he is back in action completely the rovers assistant boss forecast a longer time spell for amorusos availability for firstteam duties bowen said theres still some scar tissue present so it will be some weeks its a case of see how he goes you cant put a real time on a comeback well see how he progresses mansfield leyton orient

kalusha bwalya is confident and cautious ahead of the cosafa cup final against angola on saturday in lusaka bwalya said nothing short of victory will do however bwalya warned his side not to be too complacent i dont want my team to be too comfortable or too sure of victory as it is going to be a difficult game for me the main aim of the game is to enjoy and to win zambia have shown their determination to win this final by recalling nine of their foreignbased players however the yearold bwalya who became the oldest player to appear in the competition when he played and scored against mauritius is uncertain whether he will take to the field or not the chipolopolo fans however are not being so cautious with a victory concert already scheduled for after the match featuring some of the countrys top musicians both sides are hoping to win the competition for a record third time and so keep the trophy for good the chipolopolo won the first two editions of the regional tournament for southern african nations in and they were prevented from a third straight win by angola who knocked out the zambians at the semifinal stage in that victory for angola also marked a first defeat in years for zambia at lusakas independence stadium where saturdays game is being played angola named just four overseasbased players in their preliminary squad the palancas negras have been unable to secure the release of many of their portugalbased players reaction from spanish press englands defeat to spain on wednesday dominated the back and front pages of the countrys press on thursday controversy was in no short supply with racist abuse of englands black players wayne rooneys petulance and englands inept performance but what did the spanish press make of the affair bbc sport looks at the reaction there is little coverage of the racist chanting on wednesday nights game but as does cover the english reaction to the prematch comments from spain coach luis aragones who highlighted britains colonial past when probed about his own remarks regarding thierry henry in october journalist guillem balague writes in our country where multiculturalism is a new thing we are in nappies dealing with these things and have a naivety which makes the english nervous marca refers in passing to the booing of englands black players but only after referring to the cheers of ole which greeted the long periods of spanish possession aragones no comment to questions about racism after the match is also highlighted as marca focuses on the spanish coachs praise for his players serbia montenegros world cup qualifying win in belgium which could make qualification tougher for spain seems to be of greater importance elsewhere the spanish media criticises its english counterparts for stoking up the racism issue were there racist chants against some players this hasnt happened in the spanish league and spain for many years said spanish federation press officer fernando garrido so you english reporters should ask yourselves what you have done to contribute to all this and spanish daily abc accuses english reporters of launching a witchhunt against aragones perhaps it was because their team had played so poorly and they wanted to divert attention towards this muddled issue the paper says what the boy in the bernabeu did was odd rooney seemed intent to kick any spanish player who approached him yet rooney is seen only as the worst example of many england miscreants with gary neville criticised for continuing the feud between manchester united and arsenal for his tackles on jose reyes ashley coles treatment of joaquin and a frank lampard foul on reyes are also lambasted for their ugliness marcas headline says it all wayne rooney se volvi loco en el bernabu wayne rooney became crazy in the bernabeu rooneys display alarms the writer in particular three chilling fouls on joaquin casillas and marchena which could well have left them in the infirmary and like as marca criticises gary neville for leaving a message on reyes ankle to remind him of the manchester unitedarsenal clash this month spains firsthalf performance is showered with praise with xavi singled out as the biggest star xavi did things on wednesday which were worthy of maradona the paper beams adding what a workrate what dynamism what vision what leadership what a midfield player on a controversial evening as offers one seemingly undeniable viewpoint spanish football players played better football than the english more plaudits are given to the home team with jaime vargas lauding the manner in which spain dominated england with order and quality the paper adds the bad thing about spain v england was that it lasted only minutes after which a succession of changes prevented any real competition vargas does not mention englands two galacticos simply adding in a ps i have not forgotten to speak of beckham and owen they forgot to play kerr frustrated at victory margin republic of ireland manager brian kerr admitted he was frustrated his side did not score more than one goal in their friendly win over croatia robbie keane took his republic record to with a firsthalf goal which proved enough for victory we had more good chances it is just a shame we did not take them against such a technically gifted team said kerr but given the conditions and the standard of the croatian team we should be very happy with the win the republic side kept a clean sheet for the eighth time in matches and are unbeaten in home games since kerr succeeded mick mccarthy kerr applauded the decisive move which earned the victory it was a brilliant goal fantastic skill by damien duff robbie might have scuffed it a little but it was a good goal matchwinner keane was another full of praise for duffs role in the goal it was great play from damien said the tottenham striker i always try to be sniffing around because you know nine times out of duffer is going to get it in the box playing three up was something different brian kerr wanted to try it out and it was good to see young stephen elliott getting a runout the conditions were difficult but he did well and is definitely one for the future it is nice to see young players coming through manofthematch duff explained what went wrong when he fluffed a chance to make it midway through the second half he opted to bring steve finnans cross down and shoot against the bar when a closerange header looked the best option i would have headed that every time but i completely lost it in the lights said the chelsea star i was desperate to get on the scoresheet myself but the result is the important thing we have had a good year and are going nicely in the qualifiers hopefully that can continue in mourinho plots impressive course chelseas win at fulham confirming their position at the premiership summit proves that they now have everything in place to mount serious challenges on all fronts this season they have got strength in depth great players an outstanding manager in jose mourinho and finances no other club in the world can match all they need to add now is the big prizes which as we all know is the most difficult part of all one thing is certain they have put themselves in a position to make that leap to success very impressively indeed they beat a very tough everton at stamford bridge won at newcastle in the carling cup and then won at fulham which was a great result given that they had been showing good form as i said winning the major honours is the hardest task of all but in mourinho they have a manager who will make it a whole lot easier to handle the anticipation and expectation that will come their way now mourinho has won the biggest club prize of all the champions league and that track record and confidence transmits itself to top players it is a priceless commodity noone can be anything other than highlyimpressed by mourinho he is regarded as a touch arrogant by some people and maybe he can appear that way but he has the silverware to back up the talk mourinho doesnt simply talk a good game hes won some very big games such as the champions league final with porto some may criticise his talk but the words are backed up with actions ive also found him to be very realistic whenever ive heard him hes spent a lot of money and it seems to be working and we should remember lots of managers have spent money and it has not worked the buys are now integrating and in arjen robben he has the player who is giving them that extra dimension in the early games he was slaughtered for defensive tactics and yet he was winning games you cannot win titles early on in the season but you can certainly lose them and those points on the board were vital i also thought the criticism was very harsh because even though they were not scoring goals they were creating chances by the hatful now they are taking those chances have the double threat of robben and damien duff and things are looking good i just wonder if they lack a predator particularly with didier drogba injured he was starting to look the part before he was sidelined but you have to feel if chelsea had a ruud van nistelrooy they would be even more of a safe bet for the title chelsea also have all the tools to go far in the champions league i felt they would never have a better chance than last season but they have swept all before them in europe so far this season it will now be very interesting to see how mourinho prioritises things but his life will be made easier by the size of chelseas squad i have said i believed chelsea would win the league this season even when arsenal were flying at the start and i have seen nothing to make me change me mind if anything what i have seen has confirmed my early impressions and chelsea would have taken encouragement from arsenals rocky defensive display at spurs even though they ran out winners mourinho had his say on that game complaining fivefour is a hockey score not a football score in a threeagainstthree training match if the score reaches i send the players back to the dressing rooms as they are not defending properly so to get a result like that in a game of against is disgraceful on a more serious note it was a game that merely confirmed the importance of sol campbell to arsenal much criticism has been aimed at pascal cygan but i believe the problem lies with the absence of campbell and its overall effect on arsenals defence confidence is a crucial factor in defending when you start conceding goals you suddenly get a chill in the bones every time the ball comes into the penalty area you think oh no then find your worst fears confirmed arsenal need to reverse the process with or without campbell and get some clean sheets on the board but the return of campbell is key he solidifies the unit has pace and is powerful in the air and on the deck he is vastly experienced and has a calming influence on all around him campbell pulls it all together at the back and gets the defence playing as a unit chelsea have no such problems at present which is why i would still place my money on them to edge out arsenal as champions this season hearts of oak cotonsport hearts of oak set up an all ghanaian confederation cup final with a win over cameroons cotonsport garoua in accra on sunday the win for hearts means they will play asante kotoko in the twoleg final after the kumasi team qualified from group a on saturday in the other group b game cameroons beat of south africa in douala neither side could have qualified for the final hearts of oak started the game needing a win to qualify for the final while cotonsport only needed to avoid defeat to go through louis agyemang scored the first two goals for hearts either side of half time before ben don bortey scored the third hearts looked set for a comfortable win but cotonsport staged a late fight back scoring twice late on first of all boukar makaji scored in the th minute and then minutes into injury time at the end of the game andre nzame iii was on target but it was too little too late for the cameroonians and hearts held on to win the game and a place in the final the first leg of the final will be played in accra on the weekend of november and the second leg two weeks later on the december in kumasi in the other group b game cameroons sable batie took the lead in the th minute through kemadjou before santos equalised on the hour mark thanks to thokozani xaba bernard ngom put sable ahead just five minutes later and then ernest nfor settled the game on minutes ruben cloete scored the south african sides consolation with just three minutes left on the clock mcclaren hails boros uefa spirit middlesbrough boss steve mcclaren has praised the way his side have got to grips with european football after the uefa cup win against lazio boro who are playing in europe for the first time in their year history are top of group e with maximum points i think we have taken to europe really well said mcclaren we got about lazio didnt let them settle or play and in possession we controlled it and looked threatening every time we went forward before the match mcclaren had said that a win over the italian giants would put boro firmly on the european footballing map and after they did just that he said it was a perfect european night for the team to give the fans a performance like that was the icing on the cake there have been many good performances but this was something special you can see that the experience we have in the squad is showing to win in europe you need to defend well and we have done that because we have conceded only one goal in four games we can also score goals and again that is something you can see from the performances we have had so we have good balance mcclarens only criticism of his side was that their dominance should have been resulted in more goals it should have been more convincing said mcclaren but i had watched lazio in recent weeks and i saw them score a late equaliser against inter milan on saturday so i knew we needed a second goal no matter what anybody says lazio are favourites to win this competition middlesbrough forward boudewijn zenden said he did not expect such a comfortable match after he scored both goals we didnt expect it to be that onesided said zenden we did quite well in the first half we pressured them and they didnt cope with that i think we played quite well and it was a very good game especially in the first half the holland international said boro are confident of progressing in the competition after winning their first two group games weve got a very good feeling there is a good spirit all the lads work hard for each other and its a squad of friendly players which i think you can see on the pitch he added hereford doncaster hereford win on penalties rovers took the lead on minutes as michael mcindoes corner found adriano rigoglioso whose stunning volley soared into the top right of the net danny williams equalised for the hosts after minutes with a crisp finish from just insist the penalty box mcindoe saw an

midlands wolves appoint hoddle as manager glenn hoddle will be unveiled as the new wolves manager on tuesday the club have confirmed that the former england coach will be unveiled as the successor to dave jones at a news conference at molineux at gmt hoddle has been linked with a return to former club southampton but wolves have won the race for his services he has been out of the game since being sacked at spurs in september and worked alongside wolves caretaker boss stuart gray at southampton hoddle began his managerial career as playerboss with swindon before moving on to chelsea and then taking up the england job his spell in charge of the national side came to an end after the world cup when he made controversial remarks about the disabled in a newspaper interview the yearold later returned to management with southampton where he again succeeded jones as he has now done at wolves he engineered an upturn in saints fortunes before being lured to white hart lane by tottenham the club where he made his name as a player that relationship turned sour at the start of the last campaign and he left the london club early last season since then he has applied unsuccessfully for the post of france manager and had also been linked with a return to southampton wolves are currently th in the championship and have a home game against millwall on tuesday wenger keeping faith with almunia arsene wenger has pledged to keep faith with standin keeper manuel almunia for the crunch week which could define arsenals season almunia will start tuesdays champions league group tie against rosenborg and is likely to face chelsea on sunday wenger said you dont think i would take out one goalkeeper for just one game do you i dont do that i have to give him a run for a few games its just that i dont want to make this story bigger than it is wenger insists he has complete faith in the yearold spaniard who was signed last summer from celta vigo as backup to jens lehmann if you look at my career you will see that i have left many big players out for a long time ive done it with dennis bergkamp kanu everybody its because its a goalkeeper thats all its a usual situation for me you put your best team out no matter who it is for me it was not a big mistake at old trafford and i wasnt alarmed by what happened against birmingham either its nothing against lehmann i think hes a great keeper as is almunia you can only play one of them these people are not robots they have good periods and less good periods just because lehmann doesnt play for two or three weeks or longer or shorter it doesnt mean ive lost faith in him but former arsenal keeper david seaman believes lehmann has been harshly treated seaman told the daily mail jens is a fantastic keeper he deserves another chance he has made a few mistakes but on form he deserves to be the firstteam choice with arsenal hit by injuries and suspension inexperienced midfield pair of mathieu flamini and cesc fabregas will line up against rosenborg but wenger is confident they will prove more than capable it puts a lot of pressure on them but its a good learning process said wenger im not worried as they are both mentally strong and will put in the needed workrate the gunners go into the game boosted by the news that defender sol campbell is on the verge of signing a new deal with the club and the yearold whose current contract runs out in the summer has made it clear he is determined to achieve champions league success with arsenal campbell said it means a lot to me to go through its everything we want to carry on in this competition thats where the best teams in europe are to be in there playing against these guys and trying to win the trophy is the first thing in my mind meanwhile thierry henry believes he will be blamed if arsenal fail to qualify for the next stage of the champions league henry will captain the side in place of the suspended patrick vieira as the gunners seek the required victory over rosenborg and the striker said if we dont win and we go out of the competition like it or not its going to be my fault thats the way it is if the team dont win i know i will be criticised no matter how i play houllier praises benitez regime former liverpool manager gerard houllier has praised the work of his anfield successor rafael benitez houllier was angry at reports that he has been critical of benitez since the spaniard took over at liverpool but houllier told bbc sport in private and in public i have stressed i believe rafa is doing a good job he is the right man at the right place rafa is a good coach and a good man ive spoken to him since he has been at liverpool and never criticised him houllier also revealed he is now ready to return to the game after leaving liverpool in may following six years at anfield the former france boss has been linked with a host of jobs and pulled out of the race to succeed mark hughes as wales national coach he has been working for uefa covering the premiership for french television and also coaching in brazil with national coach carlos alberto perreira houllier said if a good club comes up at the right time then yes i am ready to come back it has been interesting to watch games from a different perspective and i have learned things i have been involved in football since leaving liverpool and my batteries are recharged houllier has been impressed with the quality in the premiership after watching as a pundit particularly with jose mourinhos work at leaders chelsea he said chelsea are doing very well they have some very good creative players in damien duff and arjen robben and didier drogba showed he can change the face of a game when he came on against newcastle they have got a good team spirit and are strong mentally they have shown they can cope with all the pressure put on them because of the expectations and cope well with joses principles jose had results before he came to chelsea and i think he will have an impact in the premiership because he manages his team very cleverly and houllier away from his brief at liverpool has been hugely impressed with the premiership he said it is a very exciting league it is entertaining goals are scored and teams are always trying to win it has been very interesting to watch the game from a different perspective games switch from endtoend and there is more pace to the premiership than other leagues it is a very good product hitzlsperger waiting on oleary aston villas thomas hitzlsperger is waiting to learn the future of manager david oleary before committing himself to a new contract with the club oleary has been in talks over a new deal and he said i had a message from thomas agent asking me what the news was on myself he wants to find out before he goes into discussions over thomas the reason thomas is not speaking to the club is because the agent wants to see the outcome of what happens to me hitzlspergers current deal expires in the summer and he has been offered a new deal by the midlands club the german international is understood to be keen to remain at villa despite interest in his native country from hamburg but he wants assurances that oleary will also be committing himself longterm because negotiations over a new threeandahalfyear contract appear to have stalled oleary wants his backroom staff assistant manager roy aitken and fitness coach steve mcgregor to also be given satisfactory deals which will tie them to villa until the summer of wolves appoint hoddle as manager glenn hoddle has been unveiled as the new wolves manager the exengland coach has been given a sixmonth contract to succeed dave jones who was sacked after the clubs poor start to the season wolves chairman rick hayward said were delighted glenn is here he has a sixmonth contract so we can test each other out and see if it works hoddle who will work alongside stuart gray has been out of the game since he was sacked by spurs in gray who has been caretaker manager was assistant boss when hoddle was manager at southampton im delighted to be here said hoddle i saw the massive potential that wolves have got and their desire and amibition to get back into the premiership parallels my ambitions stuart gray has done a fantastic job as caretaker manager weve worked together at southampton and im delighted to be back with him wolves chief executive jez moxey defended the decision to give hoddle a shortterm contract we hope it will work out for both parties and we extend it for the long term he said most managers want a fouryear contract and then expect it to be paid off if it doesnt work out for somebody of glenns calibre to come in on a shortterm contract and put his reputation on the line it demonstrates his commitment and selfbelief and the potential he thinks is here hayward revealed that hoddle was one of the first to be approached after jones departure he was not available at the time because he was looking at various other things he explained five weeks later were back on track and this a tremendous opportunity for wolves hoddle began his managerial career as playerboss with swindon before moving on to

disappointed by the news and claimed redknapp had been in talks with southampton for some time it would appear that negotiations over this have been going on for some time mandaric said on portsmouths

south coast rivals when he left portsmouth i said to harry i hope you dont go to southampton and he told me absolutely not he said im wouldnt say im bitter disgusted or angry just disappointed but its

the club claiming he needed a break from football though many believed he was upset with mandarics decision to bring in velimir zajec as executive director southampton chairman rupert lowe was desperate to give former academy director wigley who replaced paul sturrock just two games into the season every chance to succeed at st marys but results under wigley have been poor and southampton are deep in trouble near the foot of the table when redknapps appointment is confirmed he will be saints ninth manager in eight years fa charges liverpool and millwall liverpool and millwall have been charged by the football association over crowd trouble during their carling cup match on october millwall who lost the match have also been charged over alleged racist behaviour by their supporters during the match at millwalls new den stadium seats were ripped up and four people were ejected from the ground a disabled fan was injured at the perimeter of the pitch and riot police were needed to control the situation liverpool fans claimed the trouble was sparked by chants about the hillsborough disaster where supporters were crushed to death in april but lions chairman theo paphitis has denied the claims he has said cctv footage showed the catalyst for the trouble was a liverpool fan attacking a millwall fan in the west stand however millwall have been charged with two breaches of fa rules they have been charged with failing to ensure that fans refrained from racist andor abusive behaviour and for failing to prevent spectators throwing missiles onto the pitch liverpool have been charged with one breach for failing to prevent their fans conducting themselves in threatening andor violent andor provocative behaviour both clubs have until december to respond wenger steps up row arsene wenger has stepped up his feud with sir alex ferguson by claiming the manchester united manager is guilty of bringing football into disrepute the pairs longrunning row was put back in the headlines on saturday when ferguson said his arsenal counterpart was a disgrace wenger initially refused to bite back saying only i will never answer any questions any more about this man but now he claims ferguson should be punished by the football association the latest twist in the fergusonwenger saga came on saturday when the united boss in an interview with the independent newspaper discussed the events after the game between the two sides in october united won that day at old trafford but the game was followed by a now notorious food fight which saw fergusons clothes covered in soup and pizza the sides meet again at highbury on february in the tunnel wenger was criticising my players calling them cheats so i told him to leave them alone and behave himself ferguson said on saturday he ran at me with hands raised saying what do you want to do about it to not apologise for the behaviour of the players to another manager is unthinkable its a disgrace but i dont expect wenger to ever apologise hes that type of person those allegations were put to wenger after saturdays game at bolton which arsenal lost to slip points behind chelsea in the title race at first he said only ive always been consistent with that story and told you nothing happened if he has to talk he talks if he wants to make a newspaper article he makes a newspaper article he doesnt interest me and doesnt matter to me at all i will never answer to any provocation from him any more he does what he likes in england anyway he can go abroad one day and see how it is but later on saturday according to the independent wenger spoke to a smaller group of reporters and expanded on his reaction i have no diplomatic relations with him the arsenal boss is quoted as saying what i dont understand is that he does what he wants and you the press are all at his feet the situation concerning the food fight has been judged and there is a game going on in a month the managers have a responsibility to protect the game before the game but in england you are only punished for what you say after the game now the whole story starts again i dont go into that game we play football i am a football manager and i love football above all no matter what people say reminded that ferguson called him a disgrace wenger added i dont respond to anything in england you have a good phrase it is bringing the game into disrepute but that is not only after a game it is as well before a game ferguson had also claimed that united chief executive david gill and arsenal vicechairman david dein had agreed at boardroom level not to discuss the incident in public but ferguson added in the ensuing weeks all you got was a diatribe from arsenal about being kicked off the pitch and all that nonsense gill phoned dein three times to complain but nothing was done the return is on february and they will come out with another diatribe david gill and i feel we should set the record straight because arsenal have not written to us to apologise and we would not let that happen here meanwhile the league managers association have offered to act as peacemakers in the hope of resolving the ongoing row during that stormy game in october united striker ruud van nistelrooy caught arsenals ashley cole with one particularly strong tackle wenger later accused van nistelrooy of cheating and was fined and severely reprimanded by the football association ferguson admitted on saturday that van nistelrooys tackle which earned the dutchman a ban could have given cole a serious injury but he believes arsenal were the main aggressors wenger is always complaining the match was not played in the right spirit he added they are the worst losers of all time they dont know how to lose maybe it is just manchester united they dont lose many games to other teams we tend to forget the worst disciplinary record of all time was arsenals up until last season in fairness it has improved and now they are seen as paragons of virtue but to wenger it never happens it is all some dream or nightmare liverpool revel in night of glory liverpool manager rafael benitez said their qualification for the next stage of the champions league was one of the proudest nights of my career the reds beat olympiakos with a late steven gerrard strike and benitez said it was a really great night the players ran hard all the time and you see how much it means to the fans we knew before the game that it was very important for the club to gain these extra finances for liverpool this result is very very important benitez hailed gerrard for his matchwinning strike four minutes from time and also the anfield crowd for sticking by their side after they had fallen a goal behind at the interval the reds scored three secondhalf goals in a sensational comeback capped by gerrards yard drive he added steven can play all over the pitch and he influences every part of the game i have said to him many times that he has the freedom because he has talent and is very important to us i felt that the difference between the sides was really our supporters i cannot thank them enough i want to say thankyou to the supporters they were magnificent to help us achieve this result gerrard admitted he thought they were going out of the champions league after trailing at halftime he said id be lying if i thought we were going through when we were losing at halftime we had a mountain to climb but we have climbed it and credit to everyone that was one of the best goals i have scored i caught it sweet i havent caught one like that for ages it was a massive night for me and the team liverpools win means all four of englands champions league representatives have reached the knockout stages for the first time english clubs

madrid to get through but its a relief for the club and players to have won we lost momentum last season but we cannot afford to to go another season without winning anything reals finish as runnersup in their champions league group means they cannot face his old club manchester united in the next round but real could be drawn against other premiership hopefuls arsenal or chelsea who won their respective groups its going to be great whoever we play even if we dont get either of the two english teams hamm bows out for us womens football legend mia hamm has played her final game hamm who officially retired after this years athens olympics took to the field for the last time to help the us claim a win over mexico hamm ends her career as the most prolific scorer male or female in international football with goals in games for the us she was twice fifa womens player of the year and won the world cup in and and two olympic golds on her retirement hamm said there are mixed emotions there are things in your life that you have had to put on the backburner and you can focus more time and energy on that now i have to see what is out there and not commit to everything at the beginning the friendly also saw the end of julie foudy and joy fawcetts us careers hamm will now embark on a new life with husband chicago cubs shortstop nomar garciaparra who was in the stands to watch her final game he has just agreed a new deal with the cubs after joining them in july wenger rules out new keeper arsenal boss arsene wenger says he has no plans to sign a new goalkeeper during the january transfer window wenger has brought in manuel almunia for the last three games for the outofform jens lehmann but the spaniard himself has been prone to mistakes there have been suggestions that wenger will swoop for a highquality shotstopper in the new year but he told the evening standard i dont feel it will be necessary to bring in a new goalkeeper in january the gunners manager refused to comment on the difficult start that yearold almunia has made to his career at highbury and he would not be drawn on whether lehmann would return for the topofthe table clash with chelsea on sunday almunia was at fault for rosenborgs goal in arsenals champions league win on tuesday and had some hairy moments in last weeks win over birmingham but wenger said earlier this week that his indifferent form was down to pressure caused by being under scrutiny from the media the debate has gone on too long everyone has an opinion and i do not have to add to it wenger added arsenal have been linked with middlesbrough keeper mark schwarzer fulhams edwin van der sar and parmas sebastien frey and wenger has no immediate plans to recall former england under international stuart taylor from his loan spell at leicester liverpool pledge to keep gerrard liverpool chief executive rick parry insists the club will never sell steven gerrard amid reports chelsea will renew their bid to lure him from anfield gerrard reiterated his desire to win trophies with the reds after his superb champions league winner on wednesday and parry has moved to scotch claims that chelsea could launch a m bid there is no chance of stevie going in january said parry that just wont happen our intention is that we will never let him go gerrard scored a spectacular late goal to give liverpool a win over olympiakos and book their place in the knockout stages of course he is ambitious but so are we parry added we firmly believe that if we can satisfy his ambition he will remain a liverpool player we have an open and straightforward relationship we both know where we stand and that played a big part in his decision to stay last summer if he was not so committed to liverpool he would have gone by now gerrard had said before wednesdays game he would consider leaving if the club was knocked out of europe with real madrid also believed to be monitoring his situation the main point i have made is i want to be in a liverpool side which challenges for the champions league and the title all the time he said afterwards i want to be winning things with liverpool not somewhere else i am a fan as well and i think what i have said the supporters will agree with we have to build on wins like that not just settle for a great win and then not progress any further my goal was one of the most important i have ever scored and i hope it turns out to be one of the most important for the club for a long time i know i put a lot of pressure on myself because of what i said and i felt i needed a big performance but i am not going to go around telling lies about how i feel reds manager rafael benitez believes gerrard can win everything he wants to without moving clubs steven can win all he wants with us and we need him he has seen that we have a good team and we can do more things in the future said benitez but if we want to win more games important games we need steven in the team we need his strength the strong mentality he has and his quality i think he likes and wants the responsibility of leading this team pearce keen on succeeding keegan joint assistant boss stuart pearce has admitted he would like to succeed kevin keegan as manager at manchester city keegan has decided to step down as city manager when his contract comes to an end in months you dont have to be einstein to realise there will be a managers job available at a really good club pearce told bbc gmr i will certainly be applying for it although whether the board deem me good enough to take it i do not know pearce initially joined city as a player under keegan in before becoming part of the coaching staff he was promoted to joint assistantmanager following the departure of arthur cox last summer the former england defender had a year as playerboss with nottingham forest eight seasons ago but has made no secret of his desire to have another crack at the job he was linked with the managers job at oldham and keegan has stated he would not get in the way if pearce wanted to leave but it now appears pearce is keen to wait for his chance at city he added by that time i will have been here for five years so at least they will have had a good look at me and they are aware of my feelings with regard to being kevins successor obviously the issue is out of my hands but it is a fantastic job for anybody i just hope it will be me bomb threat at bernabeu stadium spectators were evacuated from real madrids bernabeu stadium on sunday following a bomb scare during the game between the hosts and

result will be allowed to stand if the result remains at real will drop to third place in the standings points behind leaders barcelona who snatched a late win at albacete on saturday initial reports suggested the basque separatist group eta may be responsible for the bomb threat after issuing similar warnings before a series of small explosions in recent days the bernabeu was targeted by eta on may when madrid were about to play fc barcelona in a champions league semifinal a car bomb exploded in a street outside the stadium and people were slightly injured real will finish abandoned match

way to the exits after the game was called off tourists and fans took advantage of the opportunity for a photograph between the famous stadiums goalposts the two clubs met the spanish fa on monday and astiazaran added we thought about giving the game as concluded but after talking with the fa we decided there was no precedent for that and the best thing was to play the time that was remaining real madrid director of sport emilio butragueno praised the spectators inside the ground for their conduct id like to highlight the behaviour of the fans who showed great maturity and it was an example of good citizenship he said butragueno confirned before confirming that tuesdays charity match which has been billed as ronaldos friends against zidanes friends will go ahead as planned id also like to take the chance to say that tomorrows game will take place butragueno declared of the partido contra la pobreza game against poverty he added football is important for society and we want to show that we also think that football should be a fiesta we had programmed and people deserve to enjoy the game dunne keen to commit to man city richard dunne is ready to commit his longterm future to manchester city after turning his career around he was once threatened with the sack by city boss kevin keegan but has since responded with impressive performances prompting interest from other clubs early talks have taken place and the defender said hopefully something will be sorted out as soon as possible i definitely want to stay at city because i have really improved as a player here newcastle boss graeme souness is said to have been impressed enough by dunnes turnaround in form to be ready to make a bid for the big stopper in the january transfer window but the yearold dubliner underlined his intention to stay at eastlands he added its nice to be linked with top clubs but the important thing is this one and what we do i really enjoy it at city and i want to keep that going keegan is expected to be told there will be no funds to bring in fresh faces in january dunnes professionalism was famously questioned by keegan who ordered the defender home after he allegedly turned up for training in a dishevelled state but dunne is keen to put that period of his life behind him and said ive grown up a lot and the manager sees me as one of the most experienced players in the squad ive played more games than any other outfield players this season so i cant be regarded as being a kid any more i have to use that as added pressure to perform and apart from the games at newcastle and middlesbrough defensively weve done quite well keegan is set for another boost when goalkeeper nicky weaver makes his longawaited return in a reserve game at blackburn on tuesday former england under keeper weaver has missed nearly three full seasons with a succession of knee injuries which eventually needed pioneering transplant surgery earlier this year bates seals takeover ken bates has completed his takeover of leeds united the yearold former chelsea chairman sealed the deal at gmt on friday and has bought a stake in the club he said im delighted to be stepping up to the mantel at such a fantastic club i recognise leeds as a great club that has fallen on hard times we have a lot of hard work ahead to get the club back where it belongs in the premiership and with the help of our fans we will do everything we can bates bought his stake under the guise of a genevabased company known as the forward sports fund he revealed that part of his plan is to buy back leeds elland road stadium and thorp arch training ground in due course its going to be a tough jon and the first task is to stabilise the cash flow and sort out the remaining creditors bates added but there is light at the end of a very long tunnel for the past year it has been a matter of firefighting now we can start running the club again outgoing leeds chairman gerald krasner said this deal ensures the medium to long term survival of the club and i believe mr bates proposals are totally for the benefit of the club we are content that under mr bates leeds united will continue to consolidate and move forward when we took over leeds united in march the club had a debt of m since that date my board has succeeded in reducing the debt to under m we worked tirelessly to solve all of the problems at leeds united eighty percent of the problems have already been overcome and we came to this agreement with mr bates to secure its ongoing success krasner revealed that his consortium has been asked to remain in the background at the club for an undisclosed period to help ensure a smooth handover he will stay on in an unpaid capacity while peter lorimer will continue in his role as director and point of contact for the fans and peter mccormick will serve as a consultant to the incoming board the other outgoing directors have agreed to leave their loans of m in the company for the next four years on leeds newlook board it is understood that lorimer will be joined by former chelsea finance director yvonne todd and bates lawyer mark taylor krasner refused to give any details of the finances involved in the takeover he told bbc five live i am not going into the figures if ken wants to give them up that is up to him i can not tell you what the money will be used for this dea l is not about money for the current board in the last four months i never saw any cheques until this week from one person i am not stretching figures we dont discuss internal arrangements bates stepped down as chelsea chairman in march last year following roman abramovichs m takeover at stamford bridge in may he made a proposal to invest m in sheffield wednesday but this was rejected by the club sebastien sainsbury had been close to a takeover of leeds but withdrew his m offer last week his efforts failed after he revealed it would take m to stage a takeover and that the club will also lose m over the next six months the club was on the brink of administration and the deduction of points by the football league before bates arrival but his investment has spared them that prospect ferguson rues failure to cut gap boss sir alex ferguson was left ruing manchester uniteds failure to close the gap on chelsea everton and arsenal after his sides draw with fulham premiership leaders chelsea

weekend it was a great opportunity and we havent delivered united went ahead through alan smith in the rd minute before bouba diops superb yard strike cancelled out the visitors lead in the th minute ferguson described the result as an absolute giveaway after united had earlier missed a host of opportunities to finish off the encounter he said it was a good performance some of the football was fantastic but we just didnt finish them off in fairness its a fantastic strike from the fulham player the result leaves fergusons side fourth in the league on points four points behind arsenal and a further five back from chelsea anelka apologises for criticism manchester city striker nicolas anelka has issued an apology for criticising the ambitions of the club anelka was quoted in a french newspaper as saying he would like to play in the champions league for a bigger club but chairman john wardle said ive spoken to nicolas and hes apologised for anything that might have been mistakenly taken from the french press we are a big club nicolas told me that he agrees with me that we are a big club wardle was speaking at the clubs annual general meeting where he also confirmed the club had not received any bids for the former arsenal and real madrid striker the club still owe french club psg m from the purchase of anelka in may he has been linked with a move to barcelona and liverpool and reds skipper steven gerrard also revealed he is an admirer from his time on loan at anfield but wardle added theres been no bids for nicolas anelka noone has come to me and said i would like to buy nicolas anelka if a bid comes in for nicolas anelka i will speak to the board and then speak to kevin keegan if there was a bid and it was a bid of substance and worth taking then between us wed decide we still owe some money on nicolas which we have clear out so it would have to be above that wardle did stress that the club was not inviting any offers for england winger shaun wrightphillips he added ive no intention of selling shaun wrightphillips if someone comes with a silly bid ill have to discuss it but were not putting him on the shelf to sell he is the heart and soul of this club and has his heart and sole in this club and he would be very upset if i put him in the shop window he was an academy kid here hes just signed a new fouryear deal i dont think hed do that unless he wanted to play for manchester city football club city recently announced debts of m but wardle confirmed they would try and find funds to bring in players in the january transfer window he said like kevin id like to see some players come in weve got to see what we can do whether its a on a bosman or not we will try to be creative to generate some funds but maybe we have to start looking at clubs like everton and bolton to see how they have been dealing in the transfer market and do a similar type of thing ferguson rues failure to cut gap boss sir alex ferguson was left ruing manchester

football federation has initiated disciplinary action against national coach luis aragones over racist comments about thierry henry if found guilty aragones could lose his job or face a fine of about the federation had initially declined to take action against aragones after comments he made during a national team training session in october but its president angel maria villar changed his mind after a request by spains antiviolence commission aragones insisted the comments made to henrys arsenal clubmate jose antonio reyes were meant to motivate the player and were not intended to be offensive i never intended to offend anyone and for that reason i have a very easy conscience he said at the time im obliged to motivate my players to get the best results as part of that job i use colloquial language with which we can all understand each other within the framework of the football world englands players made a point of wearing antiracism tshirts when training before their friendly against spain in madrid last month but the storm increased following racist chanting by spanish fans at englands black players during the game which spain won spains minister of sport jaime lissavetzky was quick to give his backing to the federations decision everyone who has a public function has to consider their declarations and make sure they do not give a negative image he said we are going to have zero tolerance in questions of racism benitez deflects blame from dudek liverpool manager rafael benitez has refused to point the finger of blame at goalkeeper jerzy dudek after portsmouth claimed a draw at anfield dudek fumbled a cross before lomana lualua headed home an injurytime equaliser levelling after steven gerrard put liverpool ahead benitez said it was difficult for jerzy it was an unlucky moment he was expecting a cross from matthew taylor and it ended up like a shot so i dont blame him for what happened benitez admitted it was a costly loss of two points by liverpool who followed up their derby defeat against everton with a disappointing draw he said we had many opportunities but didnt score and in the end a lead was not enough if you dont have any chances you have to think of other things but when you are creating so many chances as we are there is nothing you can say to the players it was a pity we lost two points but we have one more point in the table now we have another difficult game against newcastle and we have to recover quickly from that bellamy fined after row newcastle have fined their welsh striker craig bellamy two weeks wages about following his row with manager graeme souness but bellamy has not been put on the transfer list although he did not train with the first team on tuesday magpies chairman freddy shepherd told the newcastle evening chronicle it is not about money it is about a player thinking he is bigger than this club no individual is be it the chairman the manager or a player souness dropped bellamy for sundays game against arsenal claiming the welshman had feigned injury after being asked to play out of position when i heard what the manager was saying i was in shock bellamy said i thought not only has he gone behind my back hes lying he said in response to souness remarks and the wales international refused to apologise i wont apologise because i have done nothing wrong he told the evening chronicle theres no doubt about it i am out of here the difficult relationship between souness and bellamy boiled over at the weekend and has led to a war of words in the media bellamys claim that souness had lied about the background to the bustup was strongly denied by shepherd who accused the striker of cheating the club i wish to put the record straight regarding the bellamy situation said shepherd craig walked off the training ground saying his hamstring was tight on friday but what he failed to reveal was that he had told other members of the squad before training that he intended to feign injury when graeme discovered this he immediately ordered bellamy to attend a meeting in my office at that meeting bellamy admitted to graeme and i that he had told the players that he was going to fake an injury in training and walk off he also agreed at that meeting to apologise to his teammates for his behaviour he didnt do this which resulted in the action taken by the manager at the weekend which i fully support in my book this is cheating on the club the supporters the manager and his own teammates he is paid extremely well and i consider his behaviour to be totally unacceptable and totally unprofessional bellamys latest outburst would appear to make his chances of a firstteam recall remote but even before newcastle said the player would not be sold bellamy insisted he had no intention of handing in a transfer request i dont want the fans to think for one minute that i wouldnt play for this club he said id play anywhere for this club even in goal its a very difficult situation for me at the moment but id never ask to leave this club this club means so much to me i couldnt do it because i know i couldnt come back here and play against newcastle it would hurt too much mcclaren eyes uefa cup top spot steve mcclaren wants his middlesbrough team to win their uefa cup group by beating partizan belgrade boro have already qualified for the knockout stages alongside partizan and villareal at the expense of lazio but boss mcclaren is looking for a victory which would mean they avoid a team that has played in the champions league in fridays thirdround draw to need a win to finish top is fantastic but it is going to be a tough one mcclaren said when the draw was made i thought it was the toughest group of them all and so it has proved lazio were favourites villarreal have been semifinalists and partizan have fantastic experience in europe the pleasing thing is we did the business in the first two games winning those two has put us in a great position and it has been a fantastic experience playing these teams spurs to sign iceland u star tottenham are primed to snap up iceland under international emil hallfredsson after he impressed on trial at white hart lane the yearold midfielder who plays for fh hafnarfjordur also starred in the uefa cup match against scottish side dunfermline earlier this season spurs have agreed a fee for the player who has yet to agree personal terms he had offers from two other clubs but he decided to come to tottenham said spurs sporting director frank arnesen he is a leftsided player a position we have been looking at and he showed so much talent in his time here that we decided to take him its down the road of bringing in talent good prospects and giving them a place at tottenham where they can improve mcleish ready for criticism rangers manager alex mcleish accepts he is going to be criticised after their disastrous uefa cup exit at the hands of auxerre at ibrox on wednesday mcleish told bbc radio five live we were in pole position to get through to the next stage but we blew it we absolutely blew it theres no use burying your head in the sand we know we are going to get a lot of criticism we have to take it as we have done in the past and we must now bounce back mcleish admitted his teams defending was amateurish after watching them lose to guy rouxs french side im very disappointed because we didnt give ourselves a chance losing the first goal from our own corner it was amateur he added the early goal in the second half gave us a mountain to climb and we never created the same kind of chances as we did in the first half its difficult to take positives from the game weve let the fans down oleary agrees new villa contract aston villa boss david oleary signed a threeandahalf

currently behind raul ronaldo and michael owen at the bernabeu liverpool boss rafael benitez is keen to bolster his forward options with djibril cisse out until next season if there is an attractive propostition it could be i would be keen to leave admitted the yearold morientes he added unfortunately im not in control of the situation im under contract to real and they will make any decisions the fee could put liverpool off a prospective deal but real are keen to net the cash as they are reported to be preparing a massive summer bid for inter milan striker adriano the reds are currently sixth in the premiership points behind leaders chelsea campbell rescues arsenal sol campbell proved to be an unlikely matchwinner to earn arsenal a hardfought win at portsmouth the england defender lashed home a yard shot for his first goal in months to take arsenal back into second spot five points behind chelsea but before campbell scored the best two chances of the game fell to pompey striker ricardo fuller in the first half he blasted wide when clear and his control let him down in the second half when well placed portsmouth got plenty of bodies behind the ball to deny arsenal space in the early stages but their marking was slack at a corner and patrick vieira should have done better when the ball fell to him yards out a mistake by arjan de zeeuw let thierry henry in behind the pompey defence on minutes but as he bore down on goal linvoy primus got in a saving tackle with just fuller as an outandout striker portsmouths shape made life difficult for arsenal but a delightful touch by robin van persie gave henry a sight of goal although the angle was too tight for his shot to trouble jamie ashdown ashdown caused hearts to flutter on minutes when he missed his punch at a corner and kolo toure headed just wide and as arsenal began to press van persie blasted over a good opportunity after henry had set him up henry took a quick return pass from vieira but ashdown was out quickly to block and there were some anxious seconds for pompey as the ball ran loose before matthew taylor cleared after playing second fiddle portsmouth should have taken the lead on minutes referee howard webb played a good advantage to allow steve stone to send gary oneil away but having shrugged off toure the pompey midfielder planted his shot wide from yards as halftime approached henry teased a shot through a ruck of players and inches wide at the other end fuller broke clear but failed to hit the target as toure closed him down fuller was given the best chance of the match so far on minutes when patrik bergers break and slipped pass played him clear but a poor first touch lost him the opportunity and even when he checked back and went down under vieiras challenge referee webb was not interested fuller paid the price when he gave way on minutes to aiyegbeni yakubu who returned after six weeks out with a knee injury but it needed alert reflexes and safe handling from ashdown to cling on to van persies shot as henry sniffed for scraps portsmouth were growing in confidence and keeper manuel almunia had to stand his ground to beat away a powerful shot from berger arsenal were struggling to find their rhythm but took the lead through the unlikely source of campbell the england defender needed little invitation as pompey backed off to stride forward and lash a ferocious shot past ashdown arsenal might have stretched their lead two minutes later when mathieu flamini escaped his marker to flash a header wide from henrys freekick almunia went full length to grab bergers longrange shot while ashdown palmed away substitute dennis bergkamps shot ashdown griffin de zeeuw primus taylor stone oneil faye berkovic berger lualua fuller yakubu subs not used hislop quashie cisse almunia lauren toure campbell cole pires flamini vieira clichy van persie bergkamp henry subs not used lehmann fabregas senderos hoyte cole campbell h webb s yorkshire strachan turns down pompey former southampton manager gordon strachan has rejected the chance to become portsmouths new boss the scot was pompey chairman milan mandarics first choice to replace harry redknapp who left fratton park for rivals saints earlier in december i think its a fantastic job for anybody apart from somebody who has just been the southampton manager strachan told the bbc club director terry brady held initial talks with strachan on saturday the former scotland international added that joining southamptons local rivals would not be a wise move its got everything going for it but ive got too many memories of the other side and i dont want to sour those memories he said everythings right its minutes away there are good players there a good setup a good atmosphere at the ground theres lots to do but its not right for somebody who has just been the southampton manager since redknapps departure executive director velimir zajec and coach joe jordan have overseen firstteam affairs the duo had gone five matches unbeaten until sundays defeat at home to champions arsenal but the club are still in a respectable th place in the premiership table strachan left st marys in february after earlier announcing his intention to take a break from the game at the end of the season his previous managerial experience came at coventry whom he led for five years from to newcastle to join morientes race newcastle have joined the race to sign real madrid striker fernando morientes and scupper liverpools bid to snap up the player according to reports liverpool were reported to have bid m for the yearold spanish international this week but the liverpool echo newspaper has said anfield boss rafa benitez will avoid a bidding war and instead turn his attentions to nicolas anelka real are believed to still want m before selling morientes monaco are also in the race for the player they had on loan last season reports suggest liverpool will lift their offer to m the highest they are willing to go before bowing out of any deal on tuesday morientes had said i like liverpool and i am pleased that a club of their stature want to buy me i have told madrid that i want it to happen madrid know my situation and they know they must do something about me they must sort out the situation by being sensible i am in a position where i want to play and i will have to look elsewhere to do that if madrid do not want me then its in the best interests of everyone that they are realistic i havent spoken to rafa benitez but i have always appreciated his work and i would like to play for him but benitez could yet turn his attentions to the younger anelka should morientes be reluctant to pledge his future to liverpool anelka previously played at anfield under gerard houllier before sealing his permanent switch to manchester city mexicans tracking unhappy juninho mexican outfit red sharks veracruz hope to sign juninho if the brazilian decides to leave celtic frustrated at his lack of firstteam action their president gustavo parente sanchez says juninho does not wish to remain in scottish football anymore agent brian hassell insists that the yearold brazilian midfielder is determined to win back his place but if the manager is not going to pick him thats a different ball game he told the sun thats something wed have to look at juninho deserves respect he is not a little kid hassell warns that juninho could reconsider his future at celtic unless he is given a run of games by the end of the january transfer window juninho was signed from middlesbrough during the summer but he has failed to live up to high expectations and has lost his place to yearold aiden mcgeady he has caps for brazil and hes the best signing celtic ever made insisted hassell he wants to play for martin oneill but does martin oneill want to play him juninho is not someone who has come through the celtic ranks he deserves much more respect sanchez is bullish about his hopes of prising juninho from the scottish champions although hassell believes mexico would not be his preferred destination we have already spoken with juninho and he said if he has no firm offer from a club in spain veracruz will be his destination sanchez told his clubs official website celtic manager oneill is no respecter of reputations the onus is on juninho to force his way into the team he said players get a game on merit thats the way it has always been and that is certainly the case at celtic park celtic unhappy over bulgaria date martin oneill hopes to block stilian petrovs callup by bulgaria during celtics busy festive programme the celtic manager does not view the friendly against valenciana a region of spain on december as important i cant say i was overly pleased at the fixture being played just after christmas said oneill we will have to speak with the bulgarian fa its their prerogative for them to arrange a fixture and our prerogative how we handle it bulgarias game comes between celtics boxing day meeting with hearts and their january fixture against livingston oneill believes the extra game will not help a midfielder whose season has already been affected by injury they have organised a game at a rather awkward time he added when we were out playing barcelona i spoke with the bulgarian manager hristo stoichkov and he mentioned this game to me we pay his wages we are the ones that if an awkward fixture is going to be played at some stage or another it should be to our benefit rather than anyone else i have said this before but bulgaria are the one nation who seem to organise a lot of friendly games newcastle line up babayaro newcastle manager graeme souness is closing in on signing chelsea defender celestine babayaro when the transfer window reopens souness is bidding to bolster his defence and according to reports contract negotiations are at an advanced stage with the player babayaro has been in the premiership since when he moved to chelsea for m from anderlecht but the yearold has been surplus to requirements this season souness would not be drawn on specifics over individual players but he said all i can tell you is that the chairman has worked really hard in the last couple of months to try to do deals we have said from day one we want to strengthen and that is what we are hoping to do in the coming weeks mourinho takes swipe at arsenal chelsea boss jose mourinho has attempted to pile the pressure on title rivals arsenal ahead of the gunners facing newcastle on wednesday arsenal will play the magpies a day after chelsea beat portsmouth during a busy festive programme and mourinho said they always seem to have two or three days rest in which to recover perhaps its something to do with the television schedule all my players are tired especially john terry chelsea boss jose mourinho admitted his side were lucky to win at fratton park but is still unhappy with the amount of games in such a short space of time during this time of year he added we have had to play two matches in three days which is foreign to many of my players and although i understand the traditions of football here at this time of year it is not good for your health to do it you can sit back and smoke cigars one after another and it is a good life but it is not actually good for you playing so many games is certainly not healthy especially for teams who still have european commitment wenger shock at newcastle dip arsenal manager arsene wenger has admitted he is at a loss to explain why newcastle are languishing in the bottom half of the table the gunners travel to st james park on wednesday with newcastle th in the premiership after a troubled season and wenger said at the beginning of the season you would expect them to be fighting for the top four i dont know how they got to be where they are it looks to me from the outside that they have many injuries arsenal go into the game on the back of a victory over fulham on sunday and wenger added the best way to prepare for a game is to win the previous one we will go to newcastle in good shape fatigue wont play too big a part in the next few weeks as we have players coming back so i can rotate a bit more we do not play a season with players and i believe that all of our squad deserve a chance in the team striker thierry henry along with robert pires scored against fulham and henry afterwards described the display as beautiful to watch he said what matters is winning and the three points of course that is the only thing that really matters but it is more enjoyable when you play like we did against fulham we are playing as a team and that is important because there were some games when we maybe were not there as a team and suffered for that those were games we lost ferguson hails man utds resolve manchester uniteds alex ferguson has praised his players gutsy performance in the win at aston villa that was our hardest away game of the season and it was a fantastic game of football endtoend with lots of good passing said the old trafford boss we showed lots of character and guts and we werent going to lose i look at that fixture and think weve been there and won while arsenal and chelsea have yet to come and villa may have some players back when they do ferguson also hailed senior stars ryan giggs and roy keane who came off the bench for the injured john oshea roy came on and brought a bit of composure to the midfield which we needed and which no other player has got giggs was a tremendous threat and he brings tremendous penetration all we can do is maintain our form play as we are and well get our rewards tv calls after carroll error spurs boss martin jol said his team were robbed at manchester united after pedro mendes shot clearly crossed the line but was not given the referee is already wearing an earpiece so why cant we just stop the game and get the decision right said jol after the draw but at the end of the day its so obvious that pedros shot was over the line its incredible we feel robbed but its difficult for the linesman and referee to see it mendes shot from yards and united goalkeeper roy carroll spilled the ball into his own net before hooking it clear jol added we are not talking about the ball being a couple of centimetres or an inch or two over the line it was a metre inside the goal what really annoys me is that we are here in watching something on a tv monitor within two seconds of the incident occurring and the referee isnt told about it we didnt play particularly well but i am pleased even now with a point although we should have had three mendes could not believe the goal was not given after seeing a replay he said my reaction on the pitch was to celebrate it was a very nice goal it was clearly over the line ive never seen one so over the line and not given in my career its really really over what can you do but laugh about it its a nice goal and one to keep in my memory even though it didnt count its not every game you score from the halfway line manchester united manager sir alex ferguson sympathised with tottenham and said the incident highlighted the need for video technology i think it hammers home what a lot of people have been asking for and thats that technology should play a part in the game ferguson told mutv what i was against originally was the time factor in video replays but i read an article the other day which suggested that if a referee cant make up his mind after seconds of watching a video replay then the game should carry on thirty seconds is about the same amount of time it takes to organise a freekick or take a corner or a goalkick so you wouldnt be wasting a lot of time i think you could start off by using it for goalline decisions i think that would be an opening into a new area of football arsenal boss arsene wenger also used the incident to highlight the need for video technology when the whole world apart from the referee has seen there should be a goal at old trafford that just reinforces what i feel there should be video evidence said wenger its a great example of where the referee could have asked to see a replay and would have seen in five seconds that it was a goal hodgson shoulders england blame flyhalf charlie hodgson admitted his wayward kicking played a big part in englands defeat to france hodgson failed to convert three penalties and also missed a relatively easy drop goal attempt which would have given england a late win im very disappointed with the result and with my myself hodgson said it is very hard to take but its something i will have to get through and come back stronger my trainings been good but it just didnt happen hodgson revealed that olly barkley had taken three penalties because they were out of my range but the centre could not convert his opportunities either particularly the drop goal late on it wasnt a good strike he added i felt as soon as it hit my boot it had missed its very disappointing but i must recover andy robinson said he would keep working on the kicking with his squad however the england coach added that he would take some positives from the defeat we went out to play and played some very good rugby and what have france done he said they won the game from kicking penalties from our m line its very frustrating the lads showed a lot of ambition in the first half they went out to sustain it in the second but couldnt build on it we took the ball into contact and you know when you do that it is a lottery whether the referee is going to give the penalty to your side or the other side we have lost a game we should have won there is a fine line between winning and losing and for the second week weve been on the wrong side of that line and it hurts england went in at halftime with a lead but they failed to score in the second half and dimitri yachvili slotted over four penalties as france overhauled the deficit england skipper jason robinson admitted his side failed to cope with frances improved secondhalf display we controlled the game in the first half but we knew that they would come out and try everything after halftime he said we made a lot of mistakes in the second half and they punished us they took their chances when they came its very disappointing last week we lost by two points now one point vickery out of six nations england tighthead prop phil vickery has been ruled out of the rest of the rbs six nations after breaking a bone in his right forearm vickery was injured as his club side gloucester beat bath in the west country derby on saturday he could be joined on the sidelines by bath centre olly barkley who sat out the derby due to a leg injury barkley will have a scan on sunday and might miss englands trip to six nations leaders ireland next weekend the news is just the latest blow for coach andy robinson who has seen his side lose their opening two matches in the six nations robinson is already without world cup winners jonny wilkinson will greenwood mike tindall richard hill and trevor woodman through injury vickery has broken the radius a large bone in his forearm he only returned to the england side last weekend after a longterm back injury which was followed by a fractured eye socket and the gloucester prop was only recalled after leicester tighthead julian white suffered a neck injury which has already seen him ruled out of the ireland game bath prop matt stevens is the only remaining tighthead in englands training squad and could be involved against ireland but he has to play second fiddle at club level to duncan bell who excelled for england a against france and may now be called into the squad the extent of barkleys injury is not yet clear but bath boss john connolly rates him no better than to face ireland barkley played at inside cente in englands defeat by france and if he is unable to play englands constantlychanging midfield will once again have to be altered robinson could choose to recall mathew tait or henry paul although tait endured a nightmare for newcastle against leicester on saturday and paul limped off with an ankle injury against bath inform leicester centre ollie smith is the other outstanding candidate and two tries against newcastle will have boosted his chances flyhalf andy goode is also a strong contender for the matchday after an immaculate kicking display on saturday england fourth in the six nations table with zero points play ireland top of the table in dublin on february kickoff gmt yachvili savours france comeback france scrumhalf dimitri yachvili praised his team after they fought back to beat england in the six nations clash at twickenham yachvili kicked all of frances points as they staged a secondhalf revival we didnt play last week against scotland and we didnt play in the first half against england he said but were very proud to beat england at twickenham we were just defending in the first half and we said we had to put them under pressure we did well yachvili admitted erratic kicking from englands charlie hodgson and olly barkley who missed six penalties and a drop goal chance between them had been decisive i know what its like with kicking when you miss some its very hard mentally but it went well for us he said france captain fabien pelous insisted his side never doubted they could secure their first win against england at twickenham since france were down at halftime but pelous said noone was down at halftime we were still confident we said we only had points against us which was not much the plan was to keep hold of possession and pressure england to losing their composure france coach bernard laporte accepted his side had not played well we know we have to play better to defend the title he said im not happy we didnt score a try but were happy because we won lewsey puzzle over disallowed try englands josh lewsey has claimed he was denied a late try in his sides six nations loss to ireland the wasps wing insisted he grounded the ball when he was bundled over the line and said referee jonathan kaplan had made a wrong decision im positive i touched the ball down over the line lewsey told bbc sport it certainly wasnt a turnover i was driven over and i put the ball on the ground the whistle went and i let go of the ball lewsey added one of the irish players scooped it back after the whistle and to our surprise the referee then gave a turnover as far as im concerned that incident and mark cuetos effort from charlie hodgsons crossfield kick that led to what looked like a good try were the two key elements in the game cueto was also puzzled as to why his try had been disallowed by kaplan i dont think i could have been offside for without a doubt i was behind the ball said the sale player the move was a planned technique it was not off the cuff we rehearse it time and time again i wouldnt say we were robbed some decisions go with you and some go against you today they went against us and thats tough at international level fuming robinson blasts officials england coach andy robinson insisted he was livid after his side were denied two tries in sundays six nations loss to ireland in dublin mark cuetos firsthalf effort was ruled out for offside before the referee spurned tv replays when england crashed over in the dying minutes im absolutely spitting im livid theres two tries weve been cost robinson told bbc sport weve got to go back to technology i dont know why we didnt south african referee jonathan kaplan ruled that cueto was ahead of charlie hodgson when the flyhalf hoisted his crossfield kick for the sale wing to gather kaplan then declined the chance to consult the fourth official when josh lewsey took the ball over the irish line under a pile of bodies for what could have been the gamewinning try i think mark cueto scored a perfectly legal try and i think he should have gone to the video referee on josh lewsey said robinson it is how we use the technology it is there and it should be used i am still trying to work out the cueto try i have looked at both and they both looked tries we are very disappointed and this will hurt there is no doubt about that we are upset now but the referee is in charge and he has called it his way and we have got to be able to cope with that we did everything we could have done to win the game i am very proud of my players and with a couple of decisions this could have been a very famous victory i thought we dominated matt stevens had an awesome game at tighthead prop while the likes of charlie hodgson martin corry and lewis moody all came through well josh lewsey was awesome and every one of the forwards stood up out there given the pressure we were under credit must go to all the players we have done everything but win a game of rugby but ireland are a good side they defended magnificently and theyve got every chance of winning this six nations england have lost their first three matches in this years six nations and four out of their six games since robinson took over from sir clive woodward in september ogara revels in ireland victory ireland flyhalf ronan ogara hailed his sides victory over england as a special win the munster number kicked a total of points including two drop goals to help keep alive their grand slam hopes he told bbc sport we made hard work of it but its still special to beat england i had three chances to win the game but didnt we have work to do after this but we never take a victory over england lightly ireland hooker shane byrne echoed ogaras comments but admitted the game had been englands best outing in the six nations byrne said it was a really really hard game but from one to in our team we worked really really hard we just had to stick to our defensive pattern trust ourselves and trust those around us all round it was fantastic ireland captain brian odriscoll who scored his sides only try said we are delighted we felt if we performed well then we would win but with england also having played very well it makes it all the sweeter we did get the bounce of the ball and some days that happens and youve just got to jump on the back of it ireland coach eddie osullivan was surprised that england coach andy robinson said he was certain mark cueto was onside for a disallowed try just before the break andy was sitting two yards from me and i couldnt see whether he was offside or not so i dont know how andy could have known said osullivan what i do know is that england played well and when that happens it makes a very good victory for us we had to defend for long periods and that is all good for the confidence of the team i think our try was very well worked it was a gem as good a try as we have scored for a while osullivan also rejected robinsons contention england dominated the forward play i think we lost one lineout and they lost four or five so i dont know how that adds up to domination he said odriscoll also insisted ireland were happy to handle the pressure of being considered favourites to win the six nations title this season for the first time we have been able to play with the favourites tag he said hopefully we have proved that today and can continue to keep doing so as for my try it was a move we had worked on all week there was a bit of magic from geordan murphy and it was a great break from denis hickie thomas out of six nations wales captain gareth thomas has been ruled out of the rest of the six nations with a broken thumb the fullback will have surgery on monday after fracturing his thumb in the win over france on saturday but welsh legend phil bennett insisted wales can cope without thomas as they chase a first grand slam in years bennett told bbc sport such is the spirit in the camp theyll put kevin morgan at rhys williams at wing and just carry on thomas will miss the match against scotland on march and what promises to be a huge encounter against the irish six days later bennett added its a setback hes a great captain he leads from the front and the boys love him thomas was replaced at halftime by williams as his side turned around a deficit in paris with gareth missing i would think michael owen will be our captain said wales coach mike ruddock he did a great job in the second half in france he has been vicecaptain all along throughout the championship wales travel to edinburgh to take on scotland in a fortnight and then host ireland in cardiff in the final round of matches in what could be the grand slam and championship decider bennett an inspirational flyhalf for llanelli and wales in the s insisted the national team were entering a new golden period it was a great game and a magnificent result for wales bennett told bbc radio five lives sportsweek programme the way this young team are blending the glory days are on their way back we couldnt get possession early on and france dominated and scored two tries had they been ruthless wales could have gone into the interval points down but they didnt take their chances wales defended fairly well but you cannot give that sort of quality ball to good sides the all blacks would have been ruthless and buried us in the first half but the character we showed in the second half was quite outstanding wales coach elated with win mike ruddock paid tribute to his wales side after they came from down to beat france in the six nations after going two tries down in minutes we had to show character said the national team coach i didnt have to tell them anything at halftime because those players have stared down the barrel of a gun before they decided they didnt want to do that again and came out fighting it was a great team effort and we showed great character to come back manofthematch stephen jones who kicked three penalties a drop goal and conversion was ecstatic following after the win at stade de france its just a special moment two years ago we didnt win a single game in the six nations but were a very happy camp now he said we worked hard as a squad and im a proud welshman weve got hard matches to come so were just happy with the start double try scorer martyn williams was keen not to talk about a possible grand slam for wales weve got more selfbelief these days two or three years ago we might have collapsed after going behind so early theres no mention of a grand slam among the players weve got a tough game against scotland at murrayfield they could bring us crashing down to earth newcastle gloucester newcastle centre mathew tait answered his critics as he scored one try and made another but he could not stop gloucester grabbing a draw the falcons were down at the break before tait recently axed by england after just one six nations outing inspired his side to a lead a lastgasp touchdown from luke narraway pulled the visitors level but gloucester missed out on victory when henry paul fluffed the conversion and seti kiole was denied a late try newcastle had a couple of chances at the start of the second half with lineouts in the corner but they failed to make them count until joe shaw found dave walder who released mark mayerholfer in his own the former all black broke clear and popped the ball up for tait on halfway he chipped ahead for michael stephenson to scorch through for the try which walder converted to give newcastle a lifeline they grabbed it with both hands mayerhofler breaking through and tait making a brilliant early run to cut inside and race m to score walder converted to make it before he was just wide with a m penalty in the th minute mayerhofler then scythed through the middle for a try after hall charlton popped the ball up and walders conversion took newcastle ahead with three minutes of normal time left narraway was driven over for a try in the corner which levelled the scores at henry missed the conversion but gloucester nearly won it when kiole broke through only to be hauled down by charlton and tom may walder may tait mayerhofler stephenson wilkinson grindal isaacson long ward gross hamilton mccarthy harris dowson replacements peel wilson thompson parling sititi charlton shaw

wasps wasps made light of the absence of several internationals to sink london irish with a trio of secondhalf tries rob hoadley returned to haunt his old club at the madejski stadium scoring the opening try in the rd minute tom voyce powered through the irish defence for wasps second try before richard birkett went over unchallenged mark van gisbergen added points irish replied with three penalties and a mark mapletoft drop goal before scott staniforth ran in a consolation try barry everitt who replaced mapletoft late in the game added the conversion to become the fourth premiership player to reach points he joins jonny wilkinson tim stimpson and paul grayson in achieving that target wasps piled on the pressure in an attempt to grab a fourth try which would have secured them a bonus point but they were denied by some desperate defending from irish director of rugby warren gatland revealed that harsh words at halftime inspired his wasps side to raise their game after the restart they got a roasting and it was a good secondhalf performance when they came out and played to instructions he said gatland also singled out standin flankers tom rees and john hart for special praise they did very well the back row played some fantastic rugby he added london irish coach gary gold felt the result exposed his sides lack of consistency irish trailed by just two points at the break and gold said for minutes we lived with the best but we have got to get back for the full minutes gold will now turn his attention to next weeks powergen cup semifinal at struggling leeds weve

fury brooks robinson ready for difficult task england coach andy robinson faces the first major test of his tenure as he tries to get back to winning ways after the six nations defeat by wales robinson is likely to make changes in the back row and centre after the loss as he contemplates sundays setto with france at twickenham lewis moody and martin corry could both return after missing the game with hamstring and shoulder problems and the midfield pairing of mathew tait and jamie noon is also under threat olly barkley immediately allowed england to generate better field position with his kicking game after replacing debutant tait just before the hour the bath flyhalfcumcentre is likely to start against france with either tait or noon dropping out tait given little opportunity to shine in attack received praise from robinson afterwards even if the coach admitted cardiff was an unforgiving place for the teenage prodigy robinson now has a tricky decision over whether to withdraw from the firing line after just one outing a player he regards as central to englands future tait himself at least outwardly appeared unaffected by the punishing treatment dished out to him by gavin henson in particular i want more of that definitely he said hopefully i can train hard this week and get selected for next week but well have to look at the video and wait and see we were playing on our own for a lot of the first half so it was quite difficult i thought we defended reasonably well but weve just got to pick it up for france his newcastle teammate noon hardly covered himself in glory in his first major test he missed a tackle on michael owen in the buildup to wales try conceded a penalty at the breakdown was turned over in another tackle and fumbled gavin hensons crosskick into touch all inside the first quarter his contribution improved in the second half but england clearly need more of a playmaker in the inside centre role up front the lineout remains fallible despite a superb performance from chris jones whose athleticism came to the fore after stepping into the side for moody it is more likely the leicester flanker will return on the open side for the more physical challenge posed by the french forwards with andy hazell likely to make way lock ben kay also justified his recall with an impressive allround display on his return to the side but elsewhere england positives were thin on the ground bell set for england debut bath prop duncan bell has been added to englands man squad to face ireland in the rbs six nations and with phil vickery sidelined for at least six weeks with a broken arm and julian white out with a neck injury bell could make his england debut bell had set his sights on an international career with wales but last december the international rugby board confirmed that he could only be eligible for england as he had travelled on tour with them in england coach andy robinson could take a gamble and call inexperienced sale sharks prop andrew sheridan into his front row but sheridan favours the loosehead side of the scrum and a more likely scenario is for uncapped bell who was among the tryscorers when england a beat france a nine days ago to be drafted in robinson also has an injury worry over centre olly barkley who withdrew from baths starting lineup to face gloucester last weekend he was due to have a hospital scan on monday while gloucester centre henry paul who started at flyhalf against bath limped out at kingsholm because of an ankle problem despite barkleys three missed penalties in the defeat against france he is expected to retain his place at inside centre although leicesters inform prospect ollie smith would be an obvious replacement bath coach john connolly rates barkley as no better than a chance to make the dublin trip uncapped flyhalf andy goode has been named in a man training squad for the ireland game and he strengthened his selection claims by kicking points during leicesters record win against newcastle on sunday englands players are due to meet at their surrey training base on monday osullivan quick to hail italians ireland coach eddie osullivan heaped praise on italy after seeing his side stutter to a victory in rome it was a hell of a tough game said osullivan we struggled in the first half because we hadnt the football italy played really well they handled the ball well in terms of kicking it if thats not an oxymoron we said before the game that it might take until minutes from the end for this game to be won and thats how it turned out ireland struggled to cope with italys fierce start and were indebted to skipper brian odriscoll who set up tries for geordan murphy and peter stringer we had our first attack in the italian half after minutes said osullivan we had a good return with three firsthalf possessions in their half and we scored twice the second half was about spending more time in their half scrumhalf peter stringer was also glad that ireland escaped wtih a victory all credit to them he told bbc sport we knew it would be tough coming to rome they always give us a tough game here and they showed a lot of spirit they had a lot of ball in the first half but we got a few scores when we got into their italy ireland two moments of magic from brian odriscoll guided ireland to a workmanlike victory against italy a pair of classic outside breaks from the ireland captain set up tries for geordan murphy and peter stringer italy led early in the second half but stringers try gave ireland a lead they never lost the hosts cut the gap to with minutes left and nearly scored through ludovico nitoglia but denis hickies try ensured an irish victory italy came flying out of the blocks and took the lead through a luciano orquera penalty after seven minutes it could have been better for the hosts but the flyhalf missed two kickable penalties and ireland drew level with a ronan ogara penalty midway through the first half the italians were driving at the heart of the irish defence and for the first quarter the irish pack struggled to secure any ball for their talented backs when they finally did just before the halfhour mark odriscoll promptly created a sparkling try for murphy the ireland captain ran a dummy scissors and made a magical outside break before drawing the fullback and putting the diving murphy in at the corner ogara missed the twicetaken conversion and the visitors found themselves trailing once again roland de marigny took over the kicking duties for italy from the hapless orquera and he landed a penalty either side of the break to edge italy into a lead the only ireland player offering a real threat was odriscoll and it was his break that set up the second try for the visitors shane horgan threw an overhead pass as he was about to be forced into touch and stringer scooted over with ogara landing the tricky conversion a penalty apiece saw ireland leading as the game entered the final quarter but they were lucky to survive when italy launched a series of attacks winger nitoglia dropped the ball as he reached for the line and italy nearly rumbled over from a driving maul an ogara penalty put ireland more than a converted try ahead and they made the game safe when hickie latched onto an inside pass from murphy and crossed for a converted try odriscoll limped off late on joining centre partner gordon darcy on the sidelines and the final word went to italy prop martin castrogiovanni powered over for a try which was fitting reward for an italian pack which had kept the irish

landing a huge late penalty from wide out to clinch the game firstchoice kicker stephen jones handed over responsibility because of hensons greater kicking range but the flyhalf had already missed a number of shots at goal our first aim was to get gavin settled into the team but giving him the kicks is something well talk about in selection this week wales coach mike ruddock told bbc sport wales henson himself says he is relishing all the media hype that has been heaped on him since last saturdays game i thrive on it and think it makes me perform better he said im glad its a short week before the italy game there was so much buildup before england but we fly out to rome on thursday and well be back playing again wales critical of clumsy grewcock wales coach mike ruddock says england lock danny grewcock needs to review his actions after he kicked dwayne peel trouble flared at a ruck in the first half of wales win in cardiff as grewcock came recklessly over the top with his boot leaving peel bloodied grewcock was sinbinned with wales captain gareth thomas for retaliation its up to the citing commissioner said ruddock im not saying its deliberate but grewcock did a similar thing for bath against leinster last june grewcock was banned from rugby for two months for reckless use of a boot in a match against new zealand six years earlier also in new zealand grewcock became only the second england player to be sent off in tests the player himself and his captain jason robinson have both said that the clash with peel was accidental if the ball is at the back of the ruck and i feel i can step over and disrupt it then i will do that said grewcock but ruddock feels that the england man should be more careful the boy himself should look at his actions it was a clumsy piece of footwork he said hes a great player and i dont want to knock him we wont be calling for the match commissioner to review the incident im not going to go too far with the lad it could just be a clumsy action and dwayne had just a minor cut the referees interpretation was that grewcock was attempting to step over the ruck ruddock also warned his rbs nations championship rivals that his team can make massive improvements we created more opportunities and also squandered them by taking more contact and playing more individually said the coach weve looked through things on the video debrief and there were definitely a lot of chances that we wasted in the forthcoming games ruddock may use penalty hero gavin henson as his firstchoice kicker in place of stephen jones our first aim was to get gavin settled into the team but its something well talk about in selection this week said ruddock wales make two changes for france wales coach mike ruddock has made two changes from the team that beat italy for saturdays trip to france kevin morgan takes over from his injured newportgwent dragons colleague hal luscombe on the right wing and in the pack neathswansea ospreys forward ryan jones is preferred at blindside flanker to jonathan thomas thomas a tryscorer in rome drops down to the bench instead of ian gough while cardiff back rhys williams steps up in place of morgan luscombe is sidelined by a hamstring problem sustained during the six nations game against italy last weekend however the experienced and inform morgan was already pushing hard for a start at stade de france due to his impressive performances from the bench kevin was very much in the selection mix anyway and the unfortunate injury to hal gives him the chance to start said ruddock now that ryan jones has recovered from injury we have increased the options in the back row jonathan thomas is unlucky to lose his spot after performing well against italy and scoring a try but such is the competition for places that every position is debated in detail for this particular game we felt we might not always be afforded the open spaces out wide we were able to exploit against italy so an extra big ballcarrier in the backrow is thought to be necessary on this occasion obviously its a man game these days and there is every chance that jonathan will be making an impact from the bench wales have beaten france on two of their last three visits to paris and another victory this time around would keep them firmly on course for a first five or six nations title triumph since graham henry former wales coach said a couple of years ago that we should be bold when going to france and he was proved right said ruddock that is a great way to approach the game and something we will further endorse

with a sixtry victory in rome tries from jonathan thomas tom shanklin and martyn williams gave the visitors a halftime advantage luciano orquera did reply with one for italy but secondhalf efforts from brent cockbain shane williams and robert sidoli sealed victory flyhalf stephen jones added four conversions as wales maintained their superb start to this years tournament starting full of confidence after their victory over england the visitors scored the opening try after just four minutes diminutive wing shane williams fielded a kick ahead and danced past the onrushing andrea masi and aaron persico into the italian half his pass to tom shanklin appeared forward but when the centre was held up short the ball was switched left and michael owens long cutout pass gave the lurking thomas an easy runin stephen jones who retained the kicking duties despite gavin hensons heroics against england slotted an excellent conversion from wide out wales twice threatened further scores but failed to find the crucial pass and italy hit back out of the blue in the th minute henson sporting gold boots rather than the silver variety that did for england beat two players with ease out on the left touchline but his attempted chip ahead was charged down by orquera who snaffled the loose ball and hared away from halfway to score in the right corner with the welsh lineout stuttering and italy twice turning the visitors scrum the home sides forward power brought them back into it but a clever high kick from henson almost brought a try for hal luscombe when roland de marigny and ludovico nitoglia made a hash of claiming it as the ball bounced into touch wales regained control with a second try in the st minute henson lobbing up a high kick to the left corner where shanklin jumped higher than nitoglia to dot down his th test try jones was unable to convert and de marigny then hit the upright with a penalty attempt for italy henson was also narrowly short with a longrange effort at goal but wales ended the half with a vital third score to give themselves some breathing space henson sent luscombe streaking away and when he offloaded to martyn williams the flanker showed his nous to ground the ball against the padding of the post jones adding the conversion italy who lost flanker mauro bergamasco with a head knock before halftime built up a head of steam on the resumption de marigny landed a penalty to make it and a nitoglia break through the middle threatened a try only for the move to break down with a knockon but wales put the outcome beyond doubt with two superb tries in four minutes before the hour their fourth after minutes was sparked by another mazy run from shane williams who beat several players with ease and finished with a powerful angled run from lock cockbain before italy could recover from that blow a strong surge from gareth thomas and great offloads from martyn williams and replacement kevin morgan saw shane williams scamper over with jones converting both for a lead wales had the luxury of sending on five more replacements for the final quarter the icing on the cake came with a sixth try after more superb support work shane williams and ceri sweeney combining to send sidoli over in the left corner the only downside for wales was a hamstring injury suffered by luscombe but after backtoback wins at the start of the

trevor brennan could be one of clive woodwards many surprises when the man lions tour squad is announced brennan who last played for ireland against samoa in is held in high esteem by the former england coach if you speak to the players theres a huge amount of respect for the guy woodward told the sunday independent players tend to know better than most coaches its not just the irish but welsh and english players as well the yearold former dublin milkman moved from leinster to toulouse in and immediately picked up a heineken cup winners medal in an allfrench final against perpignan at lansdowne road brennan is highlyrated at stade toulousain where he is used anywhere in the back five woodward is ensuring his preparations for the trip to new zealand in june are as thorough as possible ive spoken to quite a few players and they probably dont know what theyre actually saying when were having these conversations he told the newspaper but you talk about certain players and theyll say if they think theyre up to scratch or that they dont want them in their team i havent heard a bad word said against trevor which considering he has a pretty tough guy reputation is to me impressive scotland v italy sat murrayfield edinburgh saturday february gmt bbc five live and this website victory for the azzurri in rome last year saw scotland end their campaign without a victory and the pressure is on scotland coach matt williams as he seeks a first six nations victory at the eighth attempt italy have lost both their opening games at home to ireland and wales but travel to edinburgh with high hopes their coach john kirwan has warned his side they must eradicate the errors that blighted their loss to wales however or risk suffering a third successive defeat if the defeat against wales has taught us anything its that at this level we cant make any mistakes kirwan said in the six nations every error you make will come at a high price we have to be aggressive for minutes keep calm in every situation and display great maturity on the pitch it will be fundamental to keep cool in the difficult moments in the key situations of the game kirwan has recalled the experienced cristian stoica at centre and drafted in david dal maso at openside after star flanker mauro bergamasco was ruled out for the rest of the tournament scotland have also made two changes simon webster replacing simon danielli on the wing and simon taylor returning for his first test in a year for injured flanker jason white taylors recovery from a serious knee injury is a major boost to scottish hopes he is one of the worldclass players in the tournament and you want them in your team acknowledged williams despite a record of only two victories from tests williams insists he is revelling in

website ireland are going for their first grand slam since after two opening wins and england represent their sternest test of the championship so far england were sloppy and leaderless in the defeats against wales and france and another loss would be unthinkable the pressure is on coach andy robinson and his side have to deliver despite englands dramatic dip in form since the world cup final they have lost eight of their last matches ireland coach eddie osullivan says his side should not underestimate the visitors had they kicked their points they would have beaten france and that would have created a different landscape for sunday he said this is england we are talking about they have a depth of talent and a very good record against ireland they will target a victory in dublin as the turning point in their six nations the differences between the sides is also highlighted in the team selections for the dublin encounter ireland despite having gordon darcy still out injured have been boosted by the return of star skipper brian odriscoll who missed the scotland game with a hamstring injury the knowledge that the england game was coming up really helped during rehabilitation he said the will to play in this game was enormous it doesnt get much bigger than england at home as well as entering the tournament without players like jonny wilkinson mike tindall and richard hill england have now lost two tighthead props in julian white and phil vickery while blindside flanker lewis moody is a major concern robinson who received a lot of flak for the inclusion and then dropping of centre mathew tait has kept faith with kicking flyhalf charlie hodgson despite his horror show at twickenham if england slump in dublin it will be their worst run of results in the championship since but robinson was bullish during the week about the game saying that his side are going there to get in their faces and has identified the lineout and tackle area as the key to englands chances and despite the recent results skipper jason robinson believes there is nothing wrong with the mood in the camp there is no lack of confidence in the team said the sale fullback we have had a good weeks

their six nations opener in cardiff last week and face current champions france at twickenham on sunday robinson said we are certainly not on the decline you lose one game and it doesnt make you a bad team i have no doubt in the players weve got we have still got the team to go out and beat anyone on our day england find themselves striving to avoid a third successive championship defeat for the first time since but fullback robinson believes the newlook england team can stop the rot against france last weekend we should have won the game he said but if we can underperform and lose by only two points then i am sure if we play well this week we will get the win we need we proved that in the autumn when we put in some excellent performances and we just need to build on that it was a disappointing start against wales and we might be down on that but we are certainly not out we will come out fighting this week robinson also had words of comfort for yearold newcastle centre mathew tait who made his international debut against wales but has been demoted from the squad to face france i have had a word with mathew said robinson i still believe in him he is an outstanding player but we have gone for olly barkley because of the kicking mathew has just got to take it on the chin keep working hard like he is doing and im sure he will feature in some of the games umaga ready for fearsome lions all blacks captain tama umaga has warned the british and irish lions will be his most fearsome opponents yet ahead of their summer tour but umaga in england for saturdays irb rugby aid match also backed new zealand to win the threetest series against the lions he told bbc sport its potentially the most fearsome lineup ive ever come up against theyre awesome but id back us all the way to beat them when they come over lions boss sir clive woodward is set to announce his squad for the junejuly tour next month when woodward was appointed last year it was widely believed he would rely heavily on his former england players but umaga said hed be hard pushed to do that now considering the shape of the six nations dont get me wrong england have got a lot of talented guys and im sure there are some of them wholl make the lions test xv but you cant disguise wales and ireland in particular some of the tries theyve scored have been great ill admit itll be fairly awesome lining up against the likes of brian odriscoll umaga will meet odriscoll in saturdays rugby aid match at twickenham with the irish captain leading the northern hemisphere side odriscoll is among a host of players in the northern hemisphere squad coached by woodward that are tipped for lions callups itll be good for us to get an early idea of some of these guys although a lot can change between now and june umaga said the yearold admitted interest in the lions tour was immense calling it the biggest thing to hit new zealand since lord of the rings he added as players its enough for us to be driven by the rarity of playing the lions in fact its not just us all blacks its the talk of the country umaga admitted the fear of injury weighed on his mind ahead of saturdays charity game which features a host of big names including george gregan andrew mehrtens and chris latham but he admitted the value of the cause proceeds of the match will go to aiding victims of the tsunami easily won him over the second southern hemisphere coach rod macqueen made the approach i didnt hesitate it was great when new zealand rugby then gave me the all clear thankfully i didnt know anyone that was involved in the tragedy of the tsunami but you couldnt miss all the horrific reports on the news there are so many people that were affected are still affected and will be affected for a long time its just good to know we can do something minor to help out the match will be televised on bbc one at gmt on saturday campese berates whingeing england former australian wing david campese has told england to stop whingeing in the wake of their defeat to ireland england coach andy robinson lambasted referee jonathan kaplan for costing them the game after disallowing tries from mark cueto and josh lewsey but campese told bbc sport robinson is living up to englands reputation as whingeing poms stop going on about it as who really cares theyre acting like theyre the first team to be cheated of a win england are contemplating a complaint to the international rugby board after potential tries by cueto in the first half and lewsey late on were ruled out without recourse to the video referee but campese added scotland could have beaten france in the same way but do you see them whingeing basically things didnt go englands way and in typical fashion they make more of it when they believe theyve lost unfairly england are second bottom in the six nations table following defeats by wales france and ireland but although campese admitted he was surprised about their current predicament he insisted england were no longer world class england are beginning to realise that being world champions doesnt mean you deserve to win every game he said they lost a few key players and suddenly everyones realised the ones on the fringes were not all that good in the first place added to that the senior players arent standing up and they cant do anything when the pressure mounts campese a veteran of international caps said fullback jason robinson would now be the sole englishman in his world xv robinson has been blamed for poor leadership in the tournament while his coach has been castigated for appointing a fullback captain i agree that you cant captain from fullback said campese you need someone in the thick of the action and its very hard to give orders from all the way back there some people are leaders and some arent hes not but theres no one who stands out in englands pack no clearcut leaders campese though defended coach andy robinson who he believes was the only choice after sir clive woodwards resignation but he blamed a lack of talent in the england camp for making the current coach look poor england face a potential wooden spoon match against italy on march and the exwallaby added if england lost that theyd be in bloody turmoil that said i dont think they will campese has tipped wales to win both the six nations and grand slam come the end of the tournament its been a surprising tournament he said and maybe ireland have a little bit more talent overall but playing at home is a major boost and the possible grand slam decider at the millennium stadium will be just too much for the irish harinordoquy suffers france axe number eight imanol harinordoquy has been dropped from frances squad for the six nations match with ireland in dublin on march harinordoquy

against the united states and canada was a second half replacement in the win over scotland france coach bernard laporte said harinordoquy had been axed after a poor display last weekend imanol has been dropped from the squad because the least i can say is that he didnt make a thundering comeback against wales said laporte we know the ireland game will be fast and rough and we also want to be able to replace both locks during the game if needed and gregory lamboley can also come on at number seven or eight the grand slam is gone but well go to ireland to win it will be a very exciting game because ireland have three wins under their belt have just defeated england and have their eyes set on a grand slam france who lost to wales last week must defeat the irish to keep alive their hopes

good thing with the injury is that i have kept up my fitness levels i feel quite fresh and i just cant wait to play again williams says he expects a torrid time from an england looseforward trio of lewis moody joe worsley and andy hazell they are three topclass players especially worsley and moody they have been there and done it williams added they were backups behind richard hill neil back and lawrence dallaglio but now they have come forward and proved what good players they are there are no weaknesses there luscombe gets the nod on the wing ahead of dragons teammate kevin morgan who wins

cooper dragons c sweeney dragons k morgan dragons bortolami predicts dour contest italy skipper marco bortolami believes saturdays six nations contest against scotland will be a scrappy encounter with both sides looking for their first win of the championship the thirdround game at murrayfield has been billed as a woodenspoon decider and bortolami feels the edinburgh contest could end up being a bruising battle of the packs it will not be a pretty game because both teams are desperate to gain their first win said the lock forward italy have only recorded three wins since they joined the six nations in but two of those have come against scotland this year italy opened up with a stubborn display against ireland but ended up losing however they were thoroughly outplayed by an impressive welsh side in rome last time out now the italians travel to edinburgh hoping to claim their first away win in the six nations scotland played extremely well against france in paris but not so well when ireland came to edinburgh said bortolami we are still very disappointed with our last game against wales in rome and we are thoroughly determined to right the wrongs as a nation our quest is to be respected as a team worthy of a place in this tournament and we can only do this by winning games corry backs skipper robinson england forward martin corry says jason robinson is the right man to lead the national team back to winning ways after losses to wales and france critics have started to wonder whether robinson can captain from fullback but corry has backed robinson who was given the role after the injury to flyhalf jonny wilkinson ahead of this weekends trip to ireland jason is doing a tremendous job every week my respect for him goes up corry told bbc radio five live he is an inspirational captain when he talks with the squad he talks with a lot of sense the players have a lot of respect for him its an honour to be in the england side and an honour to play under him england are under immense pressure following their poor start to the year and victory is vital if they are to rescue their six nations campaign but corry insists england are in the right frame of mind for the contest there is apprehension going into every game he added but you have to use that fear and put it into a positive mindset when the whistle goes on sunday what has happened in the past does not count for anything we have not performed but if we put in a performance on sunday then we can start turning results around there are a lot of changes taking place with england and we are at the start of something we have not got off to the greatest of starts but you need to experience the bad the before you can fully appreciate the good a trip to lansdowne road is daunting at any time especially against an ireland side that are flying high after two impressive wins they are the form team of the tournament and are tipped to claim their first grand slam since but corry is relishing the prospect of taking on the irish in their own backyard they are full of confidence and are playing a great team game he said the forwards are creating a great platform and they have explosive runners out wide if you look at the team on paper they have stars from one to its a huge task but it is a great opportunity for us lansdowne road is a tremendous venue to play in and we have to use it to our advantage moody joins up with england lewis moody has flown to dublin to join englands camp ahead of their rbs six nations game against ireland on sunday despite joining the squad the leicester flanker only has a slim chance of playing because of an infection in his finger a decision will be taken on saturday as to whether the yearold will be declared fit if he fails to recover in time for the game his place at the back of the pack will be taken by andy hazell chris jones will then start the game on the bench the chances of him playing are very slim said coach andy robinson the infection is deeper than was thought moody had to be put on a drip in an attempt to force antibiotics through his infected finger he suffered the cut playing against france at twickenham and it became infected during a minute outing as a replacement for leicester against newcastle last saturday the mud got into it robinson added he has had a big course of antibiotics but they havent done the job we hoped they would robinson has already been forced to make one change to the starting lineup with bath prop matt stevens coming in for the injured phil vickery the yearold has only made starts for his club but has made appearances from the bench it can be frustrating but ive had a lot more game time this season and im ready for it stevens said ive been on tour with these boys and ive been in the england setup for two years so i know the calls and the way they play stevens will be winning his third cap on sunday after coming on twice as a replacement on the tour to new zealand last year robinson has confirmed that flyhalf charlie hodgson will be the firstchoice kicker despite his three missed penalties and a drop goal against france charlies state of mind is very good said robinson obviously we are all disappointed we lost the french game and the circumstances in which we did but he responded well last week in his goalkicking for sale and he will be our firstchoice kicker this week robinson also admits his side must improve their lineout work against irish duo malcolm okelly and paul oconnell one of the most effective partnerships in the game in each game weve missed a number of lineouts he added it cost us the game against wales but it has improved it was better against france and will have to go up another notch against ireland it will be a huge battle look at the way they tore us apart last year if it doesnt function we will be in for a torrid time charvis set to lose fitness bid flanker colin charvis is unlikely to play any part in wales final two games of the six nations charvis has missed all three of wales victories with an ankle injury and his recovery has been slower than expected he will not figure in the scotland game and is now thought unlikely to be ready for the final game said wales physio mark davies sonny parker is continuing to struggle with a neck injury but hal luscombe should be fit for the murrayfield trip centre parker has only a slim chance of being involved against the scots on march so luscombes return to fitness after missing the france match with hamstring trouble is a timely boost said wales assistant coach scott johnson were positive about hal and hope hell be raring to go he comes back into the mix again adds to the depth and gives us other options replacement hooker robin mcbryde remains a doubt after picking up knee ligament damage in paris last saturday were getting that reviewed and we should know more by the end of the week how robins looking added johnson were hopeful but its too early to say at this stage steve jones from the dragons is likely to be drafted in if mcbryde fails to recover robinson out of six nations england captain jason robinson will miss the rest of the six nations because of injury robinson standin captain in the absence of jonny wilkinson had been due to lead england in their final two games against italy and scotland but the sale fullback pulled out of the squad on wednesday because of a torn ligament in his right thumb the yearold will undergo an operation on friday but england have yet to name a replacement skipper robinson said this is very disappointing for me as this means i miss englands last two games in the six nations at twickenham and two games for my club sale sharks but im looking to be back playing very early in april robinson picked up the injury in the defeat to ireland at lansdowne road on saturday and coach andy robinson said i am hugely disappointed for jason as england captain he has been an immense figure during the autumn internationals and the six nations leading by example at all times i look forward to having him back in the england squad the announcement is the latest setback for robinsons injurydepleted squad among the key figures already missing are jonny wilkinson mike tindall will greenwood julian white and phil vickery a list which leaves robinson short on candidates for the now vacant captaincy role former england skipper jeremy guscott told bbc radio five live his choice would be matt dawson even though he is does not hold a regular starting place the obvious choice is dawson said guscott especially given that harry ellis did not have his best game at scrumhalf on saturday dawson has the credentials and the experience even though his winning record at captain is not great the other option in martin corry who is the standout forward at the moment unfortunately england cannot rely on leaders on the field at the moment england will announce their squad for the march game against italy on saturday england coach faces rap after row england coach andy robinson is facing disciplinary action after criticising referee jonathan kaplan in his sides six nations defeat to ireland the rugby football union rfu will investigate robinson after deciding not to lodge a complaint against kaplan robinson may even have to apologise for his comments in order to avoid sanction from the international rugby board robinson had said he was livid about kaplans decisions on saturday to disallow two england tries the england coach went on to claim that only one side was refereed after reviewing tapes of the match the rfu decided not to formally complain to the irb over the standard of kaplans refereeing instead the rfu said in a statement they would set out any concerns the england team management may have in a confidential manner an irb spokesman said on the matter we take all breaches of the code very seriously should the rfu resolve the issue to our satisfaction as happened last month when the scotland coach matt williams apologised for remarks made it would be the end of the matter kaplan has vigorously defended his performance in englands defeat at landsdowne road and admitted he was very disappointed with robinsons remarks and the south african has been appointed to take charge of scotlands match against wales on march the rfu recently fined northampton coach budge pountney and imposed a sixweek ban for his criticism of referee steve lander after a premiership match harinordoquy suffers france axe number eight imanol harinordoquy has been dropped from frances squad for the six nations match with ireland in dublin on march harinordoquy was a secondhalf replacement in last saturdays defeat to wales bourgoin lock pascal pape who has recovered from a sprained ankle returns to the man squad wing cedric heymans and ludovic valbon come in for aurelien rougerie and jeanphilippe grandclaude rougerie hurt his chest against wales while grandclaude was a secondhalf replacement against both england and wales valbon capped in last junes tests against the united states and canada was a second half replacement in the win over scotland france coach bernard laporte said harinordoquy had been axed after a poor display last weekend imanol has been dropped from the squad because the least i can say is that he didnt make a thundering comeback against wales said laporte we know the ireland game will be fast and rough and we also want to be able to replace both locks during the game if needed and gregory lamboley can also come on at number seven or eight the grand slam is gone but well go to ireland to win it will be a very exciting game because ireland have three wins under their belt have just defeated england and have their eyes set on a grand slam france who lost to wales last week must defeat the irish to keep alive their hopes of retaining the six nations trophy ireland are unbeaten in this years tournament and have their sights set on a

bourgoin yannick nyanga bziers wilkinson return unlikely jonny wilkinson looks set to miss the whole of the rbs six nations englands world cupwinning flyhalf said last week he was hoping to recover from his latest injury in time to play some role in the championship but rob andrew coach of wilkinsons club side newcastle said that with only two games left to play wilkinson was unlikely to be fit in time it would be irresponsible to put him straight into a test match andrew told the times wilkinson is recovering from a knee injury which followed longterm neck and arm injuries he has not played for england since the world cup final in november since when the stuttering world champions have lost nine of their matches wilkinson is aiming to make his third start to the season in the zurich premiership match against harlequins on march that game is the day after england play italy in the six nations and six days before their final match of the championship against scotland we are hoping jonny will be ready in a fortnight but it is touch and go said andrew his recovery is going very well and the key now is how he is reintroduced to playing and with it goalkicking he will probably have to come off the bench to start and it would be ridiculous and irresponsible to put him straight back into a test match we cant afford to get it wrong with a knee injury we are in touch with england and they are relaxed about it despite not playing for england wilkinson is still hoping to make the lions tour to new zealand this summer lions coach sir clive woodward has not set a deadline for when wilkinson has to start playing again in order to be considered for selection england to launch ref protest england will protest to the international rugby board irb about the referees performance in the defeat by ireland reports the daily mail england coach andy robinson has called on exinternational referees colin high and steve lander to analyse several of jonathan kaplans decisions i want to go through the tape with colin and steve robinson told the daily mail i want to speak to the irb about it i think only one side was refereed high the rugby football unions referees manager claimed kaplan made three major errors which changed the outcome of sundays match england were beaten by the irish in dublin their third straight defeat in the six nations the international rugby board will be disappointed high told the daily mail jonathan kaplan is in the top in the world but that wasnt an international performance it would not have been acceptable in the zurich premiership if one of my referees had done that i would have had my backside kicked for making the appointment if any english referee refereed like that in a european match there would be an inquest no question about that if someone had performed like that he would have been pulled from the next game moore questions captaincy brian moore believes the england captain should not be a fullback jason robinson has led the team during their opening three defeats in the six nations tournament in the absence of flyhalf jonny wilkinson the world champions have struggled since the retirement of former captain martin johnson a lock forward and former england captain moore told the bbc fullbacks are too far away from the action thats not a reflection on robinson personally he added i just think the point of influence needs to move closer to the pack which is after all where games usually start and finish moore says a lack of cohesion in the forwards is one of the reasons why england have lost against wales france and ireland in this years tournament assertiveness in the pack isnt there were not getting enough people into the breakdowns he explained were not getting quick ball which means the backs are being stifled their creativity depends on quick ball and were not getting that with injuries depriving him of key players like wilkinson coach andy robinson has given youngsters such as harry ellis and jamie noon a chance and moore believes the last two games against italy and scotland are a good opportunity to experiment further the problem is the players that are around to replace the icons which have been lost because of retirement and injury dont have the requisite experience moore added you cant do anything about that but play them there are players who have been knocking on the door its time for them to be looked at in these last two games because theres nothing on them we then go into next season with a greater certainty of who can and cannot handle the pressure of international rugby owen set for skipper role wales number eight michael owen says replacing gareth thomas as wales captain will be straightforward because of the leadership quality in the squad you dream about playing for wales but it never enters your head that you will one day captain your country he said its an easy job really because there are so many experienced players in the side but it will be a massive honour coach mike ruddock says the yearold should take the armband from broken thumb victim thomas against scotland ruddock praised owens contribution as vicecaptain and pack leader in this years wins over england italy and france notably his role in the secondhalf in paris following thomas injury the cap dragons man says that thomas will be badly missed though gareth is going to be a massive loss because he is a brilliant player and he has done a fantastic job since he has been captain said owen he has put his own unique stamp on things we are going to miss him but the strength of the squad is shown when you have someone like kevin morgan to step in owen admitted the grand slam had been mentioned within the squad but that noone was getting carried away with the three victories over england italy and france we cant get ahead of ourselves he said we have a massive game next up and we are just looking forward to preparing for that scotland are improving all the time like us they did well in france and were unlucky not to get a win against ireland they played fantastically well in the first minutes before falling away they are probably going on a similar journey to the one we have been on in the last couple of years dal maso in to replace bergamasco david dal maso has been handed the task of replacing the injured mauro bergamasco at flanker in italys team to face scotland on saturday alessandro troncon continues at scrumhalf despite the return to fitness of paul griffen the experienced cristian stoica is recalled at centre at the expense of walter pozzebon we are going to scotland for the first away win and nothing else said manager marco bollesan i really believe this is the team who will have all our faith for saturdays game we lost a player like mauro

years rbs six nations championship after claiming their first triple crown for years last season wood tips his former teammates to go one better things have been building up over the past few years and i think this is the year for ireland he told bbc sport there is a great chance to win a grand slam a lot of things are in our favour with england and france at home ireland have finished runnersup three times including last year since the old five nations became six in and not finished outside the top three in the past five years despite being without flanker keith gleeson coach eddie osullivan has not had to contend with the sort of casualty lists that have hit england and scotland in particular prior to the tournament for ireland to win it we need to stay relatively injury free and fortunately we are one of the few teams that have done that so far wood added it is going to be tough and we need to take all the luck and opportunities that come our way irelands last game of the tournament is against wales in cardiff a fixture they have not lost since but despite their traditional hospitality when the irish are visiting wood believes wales might end their fourmatch losing run against england in cardiff so many of the major england players have either retired in the last year or are injured that i think it will be very hard for them down in cardiff wood added wales have had four brilliant games in the last year or so and lost all four so the time is right for them now to beat one of the major teams scots suffer another injury blow scotlands back row crisis has worsened ahead of the rbs six nations with news that scott gray will miss out on the opening matches the borders flanker has a knee injury and joins donnie macfadyen and allister hogg on the sidelines star number eight simon taylor will miss at least the first two games after damaging an ankle during his comeback scott macleod ankle ligaments and jon petrie cartilage are also doubtful for the opener in paris on february gray who won his first cap against australia at murrayfield last year was hurt in club action at the weekend scotland doctor james robson said a scan has shown damage to the medial ligaments of scotts right knee ruling him out of the first part of the championship we will seek further specialist advice in due course to determine just how long scott may be out for another potential option glasgow flanker andrew wilson has been ruled out for a month after damaging ligaments in both knees against northampton recently flanker jason white and prop tom smith have also been suffering from flu and missed this weeks training sessions we have got plenty of good young players coming through and we have got to look at the opportunities it represents for them rather than the negatives williams added williams could now turn to edinburgh pair alasdair strokosch and simon cross leeds tykes flanker jon dunbar also trained with the squad but is still awaiting verification of his eligibility to qualify for scotland osullivan keeps his powder dry when you are gunning for glory and ultimate success keeping the gunpowder dry is essential ireland coach eddie osullivan appears to have done that quite successfully in the runup to this seasons six nations championship he decreed after the world cup that players should have a decent conditioning period during the year that became a reality at the end of last summer with a week period at the start of the this season it may have annoyed his scottish and in particularly welsh cousins who huffed and puffed at the disrespect apparently shown to the celtic league we will say nothing of mike ruddock poaching eight of the dragons side that faced leinster on sunday but like osullivan he was well within his rights particularly when you are talking about the national side and pride that goes along with it the irfu has thrown their weight behind osullivan who must be glad that in the main there is centrallycontrolled contracts bar keith gleeson who is just returning from a broken leg everyone of osullivans squad is fit fresh and standing at the oche ready to launch this seasons campaign but i doubt whether osullivan is going to gloat about the handling of his players he is not that sort of person however he may look at the overworked and injuryhit england wales and france squads whose players have been overworked and then pat himself on the back for his foresight but there is still the question of turning up and transferring that freshness into positive results when the referee signals the start of the game already ireland are being earmarked as hot favourites in many quarters to go the whole hog this season a first grand slam since karl mullens led the team to a clean sweep in with england and france visiting lansdowne road for the last time before the old darling is pulled down everything looks perfectly placed but in the days of yore that frightened the life out of any irishman under the burden of great expectations ireland have crumpled take the triple crownwinning side of under mick doyle they were expected to up the ante further for a grand slam only the second in irelands history what happened in whitewashed you see ireland in any sport love to be downsized then they can go out and prove a point to the contrary it is the nature of the beast but osullivans side are very capable of proving a salient point this season after their first triple crown for years they can live up to their success and take a further step up the ladder osullivan has kept faith and displayed loyalty to his players and they have repaid him in spades and there is more to come he has some old dogs in his squad but he will come to this seasons championship with a different box of tricks and a new verve to succeed ireland can indeed succeed but just whisper it dawson joins england injury list scrumhalf matt dawson is an injury doubt for englands six nations opener against wales next weekend the world cup winner missed wasps loss to bath on saturday after injuring his right calf wasps coach warren gatland said hes got a fitness test in the week but hes got a good chance of playing gloucesters andy hazell and leicester star lewis moody also received knocks during their respective league matches but should be fit for wales next week if dawson is not fit to face wales robinson will have to choose from gloucesters andy gomarsall or leicester youngster harry ellis jamie noon is another player on the sidelines after he limped off in the first half against saracens on friday with a dead leg the centre who is in line for a first six nations start against wales will have to wait hours before knowing the state of his injury wales want rugby league training wales could follow englands lead by training with a rugby league club england have already had a threeday session with leeds rhinos and wales are thought to be interested in a similar clinic with rivals st helens saints coach ian millward has given his approval but if it does happen it is unlikely to be this season saints have a weeks training in portugal next week while wales will play england in the opening six nations match on february we have had an approach from wales confirmed a saints spokesman its in the very early stages but it is something we are giving serious consideration to st helens who are proud of their welsh connections are obvious partners for the welsh rugby union despite a spat in over the collapse of kieron cunninghams proposed move to union side swansea a similar crosscode deal that took iestyn harris from leeds to cardiff in did go through before the talented standoff returned to the man code with bradford bulls kel coslett who famously moved from wales to league in the s is currently saints football manager while clive griffiths wales defensive coach is a former st helens player and is thought to be the man behind the latest initiative scott gibbs the former wales and lions centre played for st helens from and was in the challenge cupwinning team at wembley in saintandre anger at absent stars sale sharks director of rugby philippe saintandre has reopened rugbys clubversuscountry debate sale host bath in the powergen cup on friday but the frenchman has endured a difficult week with six players away on englands six nations training camp its an important game but weve just the one full session its the same for everyone but we need to manage it if five players or more are picked for your country they should move the date of the game he told bbc sport unless the authorities agree to make changes saintandre believes englands national team will suffer as clubs opt to sign foreigners and retired internationals thats not good for the politics of the english team or for english rugby he argues it is an issue he has taken up before most notably during the autumn internationals when sale lost all three zurich premiership matches they played now he fears it could derail the clubs hopes of cup silverware after eight players including captain jason robinson and flyhalf charlie hodgson were away with their countries were in the quarterfinals its always better to play at home than away and its a great opportunity he added but we have to be careful bath have just been knocked out of europe and will make it a tough game it also comes at the end of a very very difficult week sebastien brunos been with france jason white with scotland and there are six with england thats eight players plus injuries players out of a squad of well have just one session together and will have to do our best to make that a good one on thursday afternoon gloucester have also been caught in a clubversuscountry conflict after england sought a second medical opinion on james simpsondaniels fitness the winger is carrying a shoulder injury and the national team management believe he requires time on the sidelines as a result he misses the cherry and whites quarterfinal at home to bristol under the elite player squad agreement england wanted a second opinion which they can do director of rugby nigel melville told the gloucester citizen they obviously want him for international rugby and we want him for club rugby in what is a very important game for us there is a conflict of interests the surgeon who carried out his operation said he was fine for us but england say he is still vulnerable to be damaged again and want him on a full rehab programme simpsondaniel added ive said to nigel i want to be back playing and that means if everything goes well this week i can target the worcester game on january for a return ruddock backs yapps credentials wales coach mike ruddock says john yapp has what it takes as an international the yearold blues prop is the only uncapped player in wales six nations squad gaining a chance in the absence of ospreys loosehead duncan jones john is a young man with a big future he has been playing with the blues for two years and has racked up mileage on his playing clock said ruddock he has international size is a big physical lad and a good ballcarrier with a high tacklecount ruddocks assessment was backed up by yapps coach at the blues former wales and lions prop dai young johns been on an upward curve all season and is going from strength to strength young told bbc sport wales his ball carrying gives us good goforward he impresses in defence and his workrate is excellent hes working hard on his scrummaging technique which he is keen to improve to become a destroyer on the loosehead to be fair to him hes not quite there with the scrummaging yet but nobody can fault his effort commitment and attitude johns a very strong man and is eager for the challenge if hes pitched in he wont let anyone down hes developing quickly but i hope he isnt pushed too quickly in a way that would hurt his development ruddock hopes that the selection of yapp and dragons lock ian gough out of the international reckoning since falling out with former coach steve hansen will send a message to other players in wales john and ian have been rewarded for impressing during the heineken cup competition said ruddock both of them have played well and we want to send a message out that consistently playing well gets you in the squad we believe this is an exciting squad representing traditional values of welsh rugby and based on the performances in the november internationals we have strength and experience up front and wellrecognised talent pace and skill behind the management team just want to get hold of the players and get out on the training pitch at the moment they are all due in on sunday and thats when the hard work starts player burnout worries robinson england coach andy robinson says english rugby has to act now to prevent injury destroying players careers he will be without a host of big names for the six nations as the intensity of professional rugby union hits players injuries are part of the sport but we have to have a look at the amount of injuries that occur in the english season robinson told bbc sport i think players are probably going to have three or four years taken off their careers robinson will be missing an entire midfield for the six nations with the likes of jonny wilkinson mike tindall and will greenwood injured rugby union has become far more physically demanding since the game went professional nearly years ago as a result three of the major stakeholders in english rugby have launched an injury audit to find out how players are coping the audit is jointly funded by the professional rugby players association the rugby football union and premier rugby as far as robinson is concerned its findings must not be ignored i think theres an injury audit coming out in march thats got some great information in there that i think everybody in the english game has got to look at he said if we dont the situation is going to get worse and not better so i think rugby as a whole has got to look at this funding cut hits wales students the wales students rugby side has become a casualty of the welsh rugby unions reorganisation at youth level an amalgamated under side formed from separate schools and national youth teams plays its first match on thursday against italy at the gnoll but that move has seen the wru decide to end its funding of representative sides such as wales students as a result traditional international fixtures against england and france in the new year have been cancelled the welsh students rugby football union feels that it is unable to properly prepare for or stage the matches the secretary of the welsh students rugby football union reverend eldon phillips said it is a shame that fixtures cannot be maintained this year the competition provided by the strong english and french teams has enabled the welsh students to test themselves in high quality matches the increasing number of young rugby players entering higher education look for the biggest challenge that is representative rugby but this year that opportunity will be denied them players who have played for wales students before going on to win full senior representative honours include robert jones rob howley jon humphreys darren morris martyn williams and ceri sweeney calder fears for scottish rugby former scotland international finlay calder fears civil war at the sru could seriously hamper his countrys rbs six nations campaign four members of the executive board including the chairman david mackay have resigned after a simmering row and calder said this is terrible news for every level of scottish rugby david is a successful businessman and i thought that if anybody could transform the negative atmosphere and rising debt level it was him mackays executive board has been in a power struggle with the general committee which contains members elected by scotlands club sides he has been driven out by people who seem happier waging civil war than addressing the central issue that professional rugby cant be run by amateurs said calder in fact i dont understand why we are still having this argument years after professionalism arrived but i dont believe the rest of the sru will take this lying down i think the banks will be dismayed at this decision and ultimately it is them who pull the strings so i wouldnt be surprised if they reviewed their position but in the wider picture what message does this send out he thought the work of scotlands coaches who have been attempting to arrest the decline of the national side would be made much more difficult matt williams and willie anderson must be wondering what have we walked into here said calder and we can now expect weeks of arguments and acrimony just at a time when we should be looking forward to the six nations championship i am very very disappointed more than you can imagine why do so many scots have this knack of turning on each other when the going gets tough a year to remember for irish there used to be one subliminal moment during a year in irish rugby that stood out more than most well at least there used to one now there is a handful to look back with a mixture of satisfaction and sorrow it has been quite a year for the irish and not just with eddie osullivans triple crown winning international outfit either right down through the ranks irish rugby is creating waves and upsetting the more established teams in the game but most of the kudos will go to osullivan and his merry band of warriors who not only collected their first triple crown for years but also finished their autumn campaign with a record for the second year in succession they also finished in the runnersup spot in the rbs six nations but in the three games in november which included a victory over trinations champions and grand slam chasing south africa ireland finsihed the year on a high the victory at lansdowne road was only their second victory over the boks after the initial success back in that success was revenge for the consecutive defeats in blomefontein and cape town in the summer those two reverses and the flop against france were the only dark patches in an otherwise excellent months but the big one of course was the defeat of world cup champions england on their precious twickenham turf the winning try was conceived in osullivans mind perfectly executed by the team and finished immaculately by girvan dempsey for me the try of the championship osullivans career is now in vertical takeoff mode it is no wonder that sir clive woodward has elevated the galwaybased coach to head the lions test side not only that but a fair majority of the present ireland side will be wearing red next june in new zealand there can be no doubt that irelands representation will be the biggest ever albeit in a proposed man squad in brian odriscoll and paul oconnell ireland have now the two frontrunners for the captaincy gordon darcy whose career began as a teenager back in finally arrived when he was named the six nations player of the tournament but it was not only the senior squad that brought kudos to ireland the youngsters strutted their stuff on the big stage as well the under squad confounded the doubters as they went all the way to the world cup final in scotland only to be beaten by a powerful all black side in the decider the young irish boys had stated their intentions earlier in the season when they finished runnersup to england in the six nations under tournament on the provincial front leinster for second year in succession blew it when the heineken cup looked a good wager while ulster finished runnersup in their very tight group for the second season in succession it was munster again flying the flag for the irish looking to reach their third final they went down to eventual winners wasps in what many beileve was the most competitive and thunderous game ever witnessed at lansdowne road how wasps recovered from that energysapping duel and then go onto to defeat toulouse in the final was anybodys guess ulster meanwhile just lost out to adding the inaugural celtic cup in winning the celtic league when they were pipped at the post by the scarlets in the final game ulster however took time to start the new season under new coach mark mccall the once famous ravenhill fortress was breached four times as ulster only manged five wins from their first outings in the celtic league leinster are again looking the most potent outfit going into but whether they can take that final step under declan kidney is another thing on the down side irish rugby was hit by a number of tragedies teenage star john mccall died while playing for the ireland against new zealand in the under world cup game in durban that happened only days after he led royal armagh to their first ulster schools cup success since the death of former ireland coach and lions flanker mike doyle in a car crash in northern ireland shocked the rugby fraternity a larger than life character doyle had coached ireland to the triple crown in the last time that goal had been achieved before this season ulster rugby also suffered the sudden deaths of wellknown londonderry ym player jim huey coleraines jonathan hutchinson and belfast harlequins lock johnny poole they all passed away long before the fulltime whistle robinson wants dual code success england rugby union captain jason robinson has targeted dual code success over australia on saturday robinson a former rugby league international before switching codes in leads england against australia at twickenham at gmt and at gmt great britains rugby league team take on australia in the final of the trinations tournament beating the aussies in both games would be a massive achievement especially for league said robinson england have the chance to seal their third autumn international victory after successive wins over canada and south africa as well as gaining revenge for junes hammering by the wallabies meanwhile great britain could end years of failure against australia with victory at elland road britain have won individual test matches but have failed to secure any silverware or win the ashes with a series victory since they have a great opportunity to land a trophy and it would be a massive boost for rugby league in this country if we won said robinson i know the boys can do it theyve defeated the aussies once already in the trinations but robinson was not losing sight of the task facing his england side in their final autumn international for us weve played two and won two this november he said if we beat australia it would be the end to a great autumn series for england if we stumble then well be looking back with a few regrets robinson also revealed that the union side had sent the great britain team a good luck message ahead of the showdown in leeds we signed a card for them today and will write them an email on saturday wishing them all the best said robinson everyone has signed the card a lot of the guys watch league and we support them fully both games will be very tough and hopefully well both do well all black magic new zealand rugby playing colours all black the haka and more the all blacks charles john munro discovered rugby at londons christ college and on his return to nelson he staged new zealands first game nelson town met nelson college on may the town triumphing by two goals to nil instigating a game that would become a national obsession and come to dominate the countrys sporting passions the game appealed to the kiwi psyche and quickly spread the native maoris finding a particular empathy with the sports warrior ethos in a british team led by ae stoddart toured new zealand and australia and soon after a maori named joe warbrick and an english expat called thomas eyton decided to gather a combined new zealand team twentytwo maori and four pakiha formed the new zealand native team who played a total of matches in new zealand australia and the uk the integration of white and maori was a reflecion of enlightened new zealand rugby and society even if the british press were somewhat mystified by the prematch tradition of the maori war dance the haka the other great symbol of new zealand rugby the all black kit with the silver fern on the breast was proposed by tom ellison at the first annual meeting of the new zealand rugby football union in new zealand played their first international against australia in the kiwis triumphing in sydney and the following year an official british touring team came to new zealand for the first time the tourists had gone through australia undefeated but their captain david revell bedellsivright created animosity in new zealand with his patronising attitude the kiwis shocked the rugby world with a triumph in wellington sparking great celebrations across the country but bedellsivright churlishly suggested that the victors would have no chance when they visited the uk their opportunity to prove him wrong came in with the first official new zealand tour to europe the tourists won their early games with a quickthinking inventive approach but press criticism began to grow over their scrum formation that left a roving forward free to disrupt opposition attacks the tactic was effective two late tries seeing the kiwis to a win over scotland before ireland were despatched in dublin a huge crowd at crystal palace convulsed with laughter at the sight of the haka but the smiles were soon wiped from their faces when the tourists ran in five tries in a hammering of england new zealand headed to wales to meet a country in the midst of its first golden age and the encounter would be the first in a series of controversial clashes between the sides an excellent try on the left wing by teddy morgan sealed a win in a hardfought encounter at cardiff arms park but postmatch talk was dominated by a bob deans try that was ruled out by scottish referee john dallas dallas said that deans was tackled short but the kiwi said he was dragged back into the field of play after grounding a try on his deathbed three years later he exclaimed i did score that try in cardiff four of the all blacks went over to the newly formed all golds rugby league side soon after the tour but new zealand were strong enough to crush an anglowelsh touring team in the first south africa tour of new zealand in saw honours shared in a threetest series starting the greatest rivalry in rugby and the longrunning controversy between the countries over the all blacks inclusion of maori players the awesome all black tourists became known as the invincibles after winning all of their games in france britain and ireland including a crushing victory over wales at st helens despite their success the all blacks scrum formation left them somewhat short of possession at times and the flaws were exploited by the springboks in south africa in employing the modern scrum lineup against the new zealand rover system for the first time south african teams defeated the all blacks in five games and the test series was drawn twoall the controversial new zealand scrum method finally disappeared after the lions tour a series won by new zealand the lions manager describing the tactic as cheating prompting the international rugby board to rule that three men had to pack down in the front row of the scrum the all blacks european tour started inauspiciously with an loss to a swansea side inspired by teenage schoolboy halfbacks hayden tanner and willie davies a thrilling test at cardiff arms park went to wales although the winning try from geoffrey reesjones was controversial following an illegal claude davey tackle in the buildup new zealands next visit to wales in proved difficult as they lost to cardiff and drew at swansea the all blacks were on top in the test with wales at the arms park but the teams were locked at when a clem thomas cross kick was gathered by ken jones for a famous matchwinning try the tourists made some amends with wins over the other home nations before a success over the barbarians in an arms park thriller new zealand built from that tour and by the time they returned in they were undoubtedly the leading side in the world that made the shock all the greater when a drop goal by student john uzzell gave newport an unlikely win over the tourists at rodney parade wilson whinnerays side rallied to beat wales their first win at the arms park in four attempts and went unbeaten through the rest of the tour but when they returned home the first question put to them was what happened in newport the only blemish on the record of the awesome tourists was a draw with east wales as they beat the full wales team in cardiff to take the lead in the series between the countries for the first time that lead was increased with two comfortable wins for the home side in new zealand in the first time wales had toured the country as an independent team a ferocious game at the arms park in was edged by the all blacks a measure of revenge for the defeat inflicted on new zealand by the carwyn jamesinspired lions of james guided llanelli to a famous win over the tourists at stradey park though and in the final game of the tour the barbarians defeated the all blacks in cardiff in a game regarded by many as the greatest ever played new zealand defeated a wales xv at the arms park in a noncap game in but it was the game in cardiff that would reignite the history of controversy between the two countries wales were leading with one minute left when andy haden flew to the floor from a lineout television pictures clearly showed that he dived but english referee roger quittenton was fooled and awarded a penalty duly converted by brian mckechnie for a win since that infamous game the competition has largely left wales v new zealand fixtures as the men in red have slipped from the pinnacle of the world game a crushing win for new zealand in cardiff in the welsh rugby unions centenary game was a sign of things to come the new professionalism in the southern hemisphere game that had left europe behind was shown as the all blacks swatted wales aside in brisbane in the semifinal of the inaugural world cup the kiwis went on to claim the cup and would inflict further misery on wales on their illfated tour of new zealand a young talented wales side left britain full of confidence as triple crown winners but one of the greatest ever new zealand teams demolished them and after also taking some fearful beatings in the provincial games wales captain jonathan davies returned home calling for urgent change in the national game but as his views were ignored he along with a generation of wales best players chose to head north to rugby league a win in cardiff followed for new zealand in and at the world cup wales big talk was made to look embarrassing as the all blacks eased to victory in johannesburg a crushing kiwi triumph in wembley followed in and as wales misery increased they turned to new zealand for their salvation in the shape of coaches graham henry and steve hansen there was a temporary resurgence in the welsh game but when an experimental new zealand side came to cardiffs new millennium stadium in they left with a victory a bruising defeat followed for wales in hamilton in as hansen built towards the world cup but in australia it was a remarkable performance against the all blacks that gave his side renewed hope wales were given no chance going into the game but in the course of the match they rediscovered the value of attacking flair to lead early in the second half new zealand rallied to a win but the style shown by wales has been used as an inspiration as they look to a better future they now face an all blacks team led by henry and hansen coming to europe with a weakened squad at the end of a long season an encouraging display against south africa has inspired a confident wales camp to believe they can claim their first win over the men in black for over years they have a chance but clearly history is not on their side wru proposes season overhaul the welsh rugby union wants to restructure the northern hemisphere season into four separate blocks the season would start with the celtic league in october followed by the heineken cup in february and march and the six nations moved to april and may after a nine week break the wru then proposes a twomonth period of away and home international matches wru chairman david pickering said the structure would end problems of player availability for club and country he added we feel sure that spectator interest would respond to the impetus of high intensity rugby being played continuously rather than the fragmented timetable currently in operation equally we suspect that the sponsors would prefer the sustained interest in a continuous tournament and hopefully the broadcasters would also enjoy increased exposure moving the six nations from its traditional february beginning should also ensure better weather conditions and stimulate greater interest in the games and generally provide increased skills and competition and attract greater spectator viewing pickering argued the plan will be put before the international rugby board next month where four other plans drawn up by independent consultants for a global integrated season will also be discussed pickering added its very early days and there are a number of caveats associated with it not least the revenue from the broadcasters which is extremely important weve got a good plan and one which should be judged on its merits dallaglio his own man to the end controversy and lawrence dallaglio have never been very far away from each other throughout a glittering international career even the end of his nineyear career came out of the blue just four days before the start of the season but then dallaglio has always been his own man ever since emerging onto the international scene dallaglio has polarised opinions to supporters of england dallaglio could do no wrong an integral part of a sustained period of success for england dallaglios crowning glory was his part in the side that won the rugby world cup in rival fans meanwhile have tended to take an alternative view seeing dallaglio as the epitome of the less agreeable characteristics of english rugby never afraid to speak his mind be it to the referee or the opposition on the pitch or his coach or the media off it dallaglio has sometimes rubbed people up the wrong way dallaglio arrived as part of the unheralded england side which became the shock winners of the first rugby sevens world cup in it took him another two years to graduate to the full england xv but once there he proved to the manor born displaying maturity and physical power beyond his years dallaglio rapidly established himself as an automatic choice able to play any one of the three backrow positions at international standard within two years of his debut dallaglio was offered the england captains band and his career continued to go from strength to strength as he made the lions tour to south africa although overlooked for the captaincy in favour of england teammate martin johnson he played a massive role in the series victory but after building up a seemingly unstoppable momentum dallaglios career hit the buffers at speed in first came the lastminute defeat to wales in which dallaglios decision not to kick for goal in the dying minutes was blamed for costing england a grand slam worse was to follow though as an infamous newspaper sting cost him his treasured england captaincy with sensational allegations of drug use of which he was subsequently cleared splashed across the front pages a devastated dallaglio stepped down as england skipper but he bounced back getting his head down at club level before returning to the england fold albeit now as a lieutenant to new captain johnson as a member of a newlook england side on the long road to world cup glory a journey not without mishaps as a succession of grand slams opportunities were spurned dallaglio emerged as a key performer once again yet another setback arrived in as a serious knee injury cut short dallaglios involvement on the lions tour to australia rumours began to circulate that his career was over but in typical dallaglio style he embarked on a punishing schedule of rehabilitation to return an even more fearsome physical specimen one effect of the injury was to rob dallaglio of much of his pace but ever the pragmatist he reinvented himself as a close quarters number eight of the highest calibre the only player to play every minute of englands world cup triumph in australia dallaglio could hardly have done more to secure englands historic win and for that he will always be held in the highest esteem by england supporters following johnsons retirement dallaglios career came full circle as woodward restored him as england captain while england did not hit the heights in dallaglios second spell as captain losing five of their eight postworld cup tests dallaglio led by example leaving him as one of the few members of a squad lacking many world cup stars to live up to expectations dallaglio walks away from the international game safe in the knowledge that he will go down as one of englands most accomplished players if not one of the great captains despite his evident pride in leading his country the problem now for england is how to replace the almost irreplaceable the likes of matt dawson jonny wilkinson phil vickery and hill have all been mentioned as contenders for dallaglios role as captain but it is as a player that england will really struggle to replace the yearold although players like joe worsley and chris jones are more than capable of stepping up the fact that there is no standout candidate speaks volumes about dallaglios massive influence on english rugby wasps leicester leicester withstood a stunning wasps comeback to win a pulsating heineken cup encounter at the causeway stadium the tigers stormed ahead within minutes through tries from lewis moody geordan murphy and martin corry european champions wasps fought back through a josh lewsey try and mark van gisbergens boot and they were level at with five minutes remaining but it was the visitors who kept their cool as andy goode kicked the tigers to victory with a penalty and a drop goal the closing moments saw desperate defence from leicester as wasps turned down several penalties to go for the try they needed wasps pounded the line and a penalty try looked likely before referee nigel williams controversially blew for fulltime flyhalf goode was the tigers hero kicking points in total while leicesters overwhelming domination in the scrums ultimately told even their lack of discipline in defence which presented the admirable van ginsberg with points could not undo them as they held out for a famous win lawrence dallaglios team have now got it all to do in the quest for a quarterfinal place given that two of their last three games are away against leicester and biarritz however wasps rugby director warren gatland warned his side will will not relinquish their european title without a fight if we lose next week then we are struggling said gatland but we dont want to give this trophy away we worked so hard to win it last season we will go down fighting we have got to get our scrum right next week it is the biggest cause for concern leicester coach john wells saluted the outstanding work of graham rowntree and julian white who were magnificent up front they were the backbone of our performance today said wells and to

dropped goal by ronan ogara stole victory for ireland from underneath the noses of argentina at lansdowne road on saturday ogara kicked all of irelands points with two dropped goals and five penalties to give the home side a record in their autumn internationals an impressive argentina appeared in control until the dying seconds the pumas shocked the irish early on with a try from federico aramburu and felipe contepomi kicked points the welldrilled and sharper pumas outplayed and outthought ireland in the early stages indiscipline allowed argentinas leinster flyhalf contepomi to open the scoring in the third minute with a straightforward penalty he was on the mark again two minutes later when argentina shocked a ragged ireland with the first try of the game ireland turned the ball over and manuel contepomi broke through an unstructured defence before feeding his midfield partner aramburu to sprint in under the posts ogara finally got ireland on the board with a dropped goal in the ninth minute only for contepomi to rifle over his second penalty two minutes later playing into a strong wind and rain ireland continued to come second best in tight situations and turnovers began to mount up against a rugged defence ogara managed to land his second penalty in the th minute but once again contepomi replied in kind four minutes into firsthalf injury time the secondhalf started as the first had ended ogara rifled over another penalty in the th minute but contepomi matched it three minutes later the upperbody strength of the pumas never allowed ireland to take control up front while the threequarters had no space to manoeuvre ireland had to rely on ogaras boot to keep in touch rather than any contrived running plays the munsterman landed two more penalties one of them from metres to bring his team to within four points with minutes on the clock remaining and irelands chance came when argentinas number eight gonzalo longo was yellow carded with six minutes to go for an offence in the lineout ogara made no mistake as he rifled over his fifth penalty to set up a tense final few minutes but ireland showed great composure to get themselves into a position to allow ogara to thump over a massive drop goal to complete a tremendous if fortuitous comeback campbell to be lions consultant former government communications chief alastair campbell will act as a media consultant to sir clive woodwards lions on their tour to new zealand campbell who left downing street earlier this year will advise on media strategy before and during the tour i hope i can contribute to the planning and preparation and to ensuring the media and public get the most out of the tour itself he said i am also looking forward to going out for the later stages of the tour woodwards decision to call in prime minister tony blairs former spin doctor springs from the deterioration in media relations on the last lions tour of australia in when new zealander graham henry was the head coach the furore surrounding the newspaper diaries of matt dawson and austin healey was compounded by other disillusioned players venting their frustration through the media the lions is a massive media event said woodward who will be the head coach there will be a huge level of interest from the travelling media the fans that will go out in their thousands and the new zealand public we need to have the strategy and processes in place to deal with the pressures that will bring alastair will act as an advisor both in the build up to and on the tour itself his role is to work closely with not only myself but tour manager bill beaumont media manager louisa cheetham and team manager louise ramsay campbell is due to resume working for the government in the new year in the buildup to an anticipated may general election the lions leave for new zealand on may with the first test match against the all blacks in christchurch on june lions blow to world cup winners british and irish lions coach clive woodward says he is unlikely to select any players not involved in next years rbs six nations championship world cup winners lawrence dallaglio neil back and martin johnson had all been thought to be in the frame for next summers tour to new zealand i dont think you can ever say never said woodward but i would have to have a compulsive reason to pick any player who is not available to international rugby dallaglio back and johnson have all retired from international rugby over the last months but continue to star for their club sides but woodward added the key thing that i want to stress is that i intend to use the six nations and the players who are available to international rugby as the key benchmark my job along with all the other senior representatives is to make sure that we pick the strongest possible team if you are not playing international rugby then its still a step up to test rugby its definitely a disadvantage i think its absolutely critical and with the history of the lions we have got to take players playing for the four countries woodward also revealed that the race for the captaincy was still wide open it is an open book he said there are some outstanding candidates from all four countries and following the all blacks impressive displays in europe in recent weeks including a humiliation of france woodward believes the threetest series in new zealand will provide the ultimate rugby challenge their performance in particular against france was simply awesome said the lions coach certain things have been suggested about the potency of their front five but theyre a very powerful unit with his customary thoroughness woodward revealed he had taken soundings from australia coach eddie jones and jake white of south africa following their tour matches in britain and ireland as a result woodward stressed his lions group might not be dominated by players from england and ireland and held out hope for the struggling scots scotlands recent results have not been that impressive but there have been some excellent individual performances eddie in particular told me how tough they had made it for australia and i will take on board their opinions and scotland forward simon taylor looks certain to get the call provided he recovers from knee and tendon problems i took lessons from in that they did make a mistake in taking lawrence dallaglio when he wasnt fit and went on the trip every player has to be looked at on their own merits and simon taylor is an outstanding player and i have no doubts that if he gets back to full fitness he will be on the trip i am told he should be back playing by march and he has plenty of time to prove his fitness for the lions and there are other players like richard hill in the same boat wilkinson fit to face edinburgh england captain jonny wilkinson will make his longawaited return from injury against edinburgh on saturday wilkinson who has not played since injuring his bicep on october took part in fullcontact training with newcastle falcons on wednesday and the yearold flyhalf will start saturdays heineken cup match at murrayfield on the bench but newcastle director of rugby rob andrew said hes fine and we hope to get him into the game at some stage the yearold missed englands autumn internationals after aggravating the haematoma in his upper right arm against saracens he was subsequently replaced as england captain by fullback jason robinson sales charlie hodgson took over the number shirt in the internationals against canada south africa and australia wilkinsons year has been disrupted by injury as his muscle problem followed eight months on the sidelines with a shoulder injury sustained in the world cup final dallaglio eyeing lions tour place former england captain lawrence dallaglio still harbours hopes of a place on the british and irish lions tour to new zealand lions coach sir clive woodward has made it clear he will pick his squad to tour next summer based on form shown in the six nations championship but dallaglio who called time on england earlier this year said i assure you i wouldnt let anyone down i know what it takes and what i have to offer he told the daily telegraph dallaglio toured south africa with the lions in but was forced home early with a knee injury from the trip to australia three years ago the yearold also felt concentrating on club rugby could have prolonged his international shelflife he said ill be in good shape and fresh without another tests on the clock from what i witnessed at close quarters on sunday in our heineken cup match against leicester i certainly didnt feel out of place alongside those players many of whom will be on the trip if im fit and playing well then im most certainly available if clive feels he has no need to look outside the international crop then fine if he does then he wont need to look too far will he dawson set for new wasps contract european champions wasps are set to offer matt dawson a new deal the yearold world cup winning scrumhalf has impressed since joining the london side from northampton this summer on a oneyear contract wasps coach warren gatland told the daily mirror we have not yet offered matt a new contract but we will be doing so im very happy with his contribution and i think hes good enough to play for another couple of years dawson played a vital part in englands world cup win last year but has fallen out of favour with new coach andy robinson after missing a training session in september however he hopes the new deal will help him regain his england place rugby is still my priority and theres still a burning desire within me to play the best rugby i possibly can he said i know within myself if i was given the chance i could play for england again i know im fit enough im strong enough im skilful enough healey targets england comeback leicester wing austin healey hopes to use sundays return heineken cup clash with wasps as a further springboard to an england recall for the six nations healey who won caps prior to the world cup has been in good form in the tigers resurgence this season i definitely still have ambitions to play for england healey told the bbc we will have to see what happens after the previous autumn tests but when i look at the current squad i definitely feel there is a place there for me healey who has also played both halfback positions and fullback during his career has reverted to the wing where he won most of his england caps after recovering from a trapped nerve in his back sustained at the end of september the yearold is relishing his role in the tigers revival i had six weeks out but fortunately i have resumed the sort of form i had before he said i am basically playing where it best suits leicester obviously i can play scrumhalf flyhalf or fullback at a moments notice but playing on the wing actually gives me a bigger free role to come in where i am not expected and influence things that has been apparent in parts one and two of the waspsleicester trilogy in recent weeks first healey came off his flank with an angled run to score an injurytime try that earned the tigers a draw in their premiership meeting on november then in the first of their heineken cup double header last sunday healey slotted in at standoff and delivered a superb crosskick for martin corry to score the tigers third try i caught cozzas eye a couple of phases before that and was hoping to get it to him on the full but fortunately even with the bounce he managed to score healey recalled healey twice a heineken cup winner believes last sundays match was up there with some of the biggest club contests he has played in it was a very intense occasion and a very destructive game he recalled there was not a huge amount of rugby played but it was a great game to be involved in after about minutes i thought we might stride away with it but wasps really came back into it and in the last couple of minutes it could have gone either way the same outcome this sunday would put leicester in pole position to top their heineken pool with a home game against biarritz and away trip to calvisano to come but healey insists the tigers must summon the same desire if they are to deliver the knockout blow in what has been dubbed rugbys version of rocky ii there was a lot of satisfaction in the dressing room aftewards but it is really only a case of a job half done he added it was the first of a twoleg trip and if we lose at welford road it will negate all the positives we can take from result i think it came down to who wanted it more and in the end i think we did we have got to show the same desire again this week scrumhalf williams rejoins bath bath have signed their former scrumhalf andy williams on a shortterm deal from the neathswansea ospreys wales international williams whose contract with the welsh region was due to expire in june has agreed a contract until the end of the season with martyn woods injury likely to keep him out until february bath need experienced backup to nick walshe said williams when this opportunity presented itself i did not really have to think twice about it williams capped by wales against romania in should figure in the match squad for mondays zurich premiership match at sale sharks he lost his ospreys starting place to new zealander jason spice and has fallen further behind in the pecking order the welsh region has two outstanding young no prospects in richie rees and rhodri wells bath director of rugby jack rowell though believes williams fits the bill perfectly he has been playing regular heineken cup and celtic league rugby and he has a great affection for bath rowell told baths official website we are delighted to be able to welcome him back to the club bath faced with tindall ultimatum mike tindalls agent has warned bath they have until next week to improve their contract offer to the england man or risk losing him to a rival club dipo alli says he has received an offer for tindall which dwarfs baths deal and that two other clubs want to talk mike does not want to go into the six nations worrying about where he will be playing his club rugby next season alli told the guardian newspaper it is up to bath owner andrew brownsword he has to make it happen tindall is out of contract at the end of the season but it is understood that brownsword is unwilling to break the clubs salary structure to accommodate the yearolds demands but alli insists the player is worth more than bath have put on the table mike has been at bath for eight years and wants to remain with the club and his demands are anything but excessive the agent added but brownsword has to recognise mikes value and we want to resolve things by the end of next week tindall wants second opinion england centre mike tindall is to seek a second opinion before having surgery on a foot injury that could force him to miss the entire six nations the bath player was already out of the opener against wales on february because of a hand problem mike had a specialist review on a fracture in his right mid foot said england doctor simon kemp before a final decision is made on surgery medical teams have decided he should see a second specialist england coach andy robinson is already without centre will greenwood and flanker richard hill while flyhalf jonny wilkinson is certain to miss at least the first two games robinson is expected to announce his newlook england lineup on monday for the match at the millennium stadium and newcastles yearold centre mathew tait is set to stand in for tindall alongside club teammate jamie noon meanwhile tindall is targeting a return to action before the end of the regular zurich premiership season on april he will also aim to be back to full fitness before the lions tour to new zealand this summer wales silent on grand slam talk rhys williams says wales are still not thinking of winning the grand slam despite a third six nations win thats the last thing on our minds at the moment said williams a second half replacement in saturdays win over france in paris we all realise how difficult a task it is to go up to scotland and beat them weve come unstuck there a couple of times recently so our focus is on that game and well worry about ireland hopefully after weve beaten scotland with captain gareth thomas ruled out of the rest of the campaign with a broken thumb williams is vying for his first start in the championship so far kevin morgan is probably favourite to replace thomas at fullback leaving williams and hal luscombe to battle for the right wing berth a hamstring injury denied luscombe the opportunity to make a third successive start but the dragons winger is expected to be fit for the trip to murrayfield on march hooker robin mcbryde is doubtful after picking up a knee injury in paris but centre sonny parker and flanker colin charvis are set to recover from injury to be in contention for selection said wales assistant coach scott johnson theyve worked through the weekend and the reports are a bit more positive so were getting a couple back and that adds to the depth of the squad scotland secured their first win of the campaign on saturday by grinding out an win over italy matt williams side has shown little in attack but johnson insisted the scots will be difficult opposition to break down italy are really brave opposition and sometimes its very hard to win he said so an ugly win can be just as effective as a or point victory scotland are a hard side and very underrated so were not taking anything for granted were not basking in the glory of winning our first three games weve got to be diligent in our preparation thats my job and weve got to make sure were focused sculthorpe wants lions captaincy paul sculthorpe has admitted he would love to succeed andy farrell as great britain skipper if the wigan star does switch codes to rugby union sculthorpe was vicecaptain in the trinations and took the st helens captaincy from chris joynt last year i would definitely want the job i make no bones about it sculthorpe told bbc sport its something ive always wanted to do id gladly take it if it was offered to me the yearold who captained st helens to challenge cup success last year said following in the footsteps of farrell would be a challenge andy would be a hard act to follow but its something im confident of being up to he said the gb team isnt a oneman team there are a lot of good young players who are pushing for places anyway sculthorpe said the rugby league world would understand if farrell did decide to move to rugby union its a short career and you have to make of it what you can said sculthorpe nobody can blame him if he does go hes done everything in the game of rugby league financially it could set him up for life if he fancies a new challenge then who could fault him sculthorpe also called on the rugby league authorities to have a serious look at the number of games the top players are being asked to play sean long sculthorpes saints and lions teammate has expressed doubts about his international future i think seans situation is to do with the sheer number of games were playing he said the way hes looking at it is that if he can extend his career by a couple of years by not playing international rugby then hes willing to do that the rfl has got to do something about the fixtures were playing weeks of the year and its too much a lot of the niggly injuries that ive suffered with over the last couple of years have come about because of the lack of rest time st helens have been strongly linked with a move for brilliant young forward sonny bill williams and sculthorpe said he would love the yearold to come to knowsley road hes a great player a big strong lad who can certainly hit hard in defence but who is also very skilful he said id love him to come to st helens who knows what might happen but you want the best players in your team and hes certainly one of the best players in the world tigers wary of farrell gamble leicester say they will not be rushed into making a bid for andy farrell should the great britain rugby league captain decide to switch codes we and anybody else involved in the process are still some way away from going to the next stage tigers boss john wells told bbc radio leicester at the moment there are still a lot of unknowns about andy farrell not least his medical situation whoever does take him on is going to take a big big gamble farrell who has had persistent knee problems had an operation on his knee five weeks ago and is expected to be out for another three months leicester and saracens are believed to head the list of rugby union clubs interested in signing farrell if he decides to move to the man game if he does move across to union wells believes he would better off playing in the backs at least initially im sure he could make the step between league and union by being involved in the centre said wells i think england would prefer him to progress to a position in the back row where they can make use of some of his rugby league skills within the forwards the jury is out on whether he can cross that divide at this club the balance will have to be struck between the cost of that gamble and the option of bringing in a readymade replacement england given tough sevens draw england will have to negotiate their way through a tough draw if they are to win the rugby world cup sevens in hong kong next month the second seeds have been drawn against samoa france italy georgia and chinese taipei the top two sides in each pool qualify but england could face winners new zealand in the quarterfinals if they stumble against samoa scotland and ireland are in pool a together with the all blacks england won the first event of the international rugby board world sevens series in dubai but have slipped to fourth in the table after failing to build on that victory however they beat samoa in the recent los angeles sevens before losing to argentina in the semifinals england have the ability and determination to win this world cup and create sporting history by being the only nation to hold both the s and sevens world cups at the same time said england sevens coach mike friday england have a fantastic record in hong kong and have won there the last three years but the world cup is on a different level every pool contains teams who have caused upsets before and we will have to work hard to ensure we progress from our group we have not performed consistently to our true potential so far in the irb sevens which has been disappointing but we can only look forward england won the first rugby world cup sevens in with a side that included the likes of lawrence dallaglio and matt dawson in and england lost in the quarterfinals seeds in brackets new zealand scotland tonga ireland korea usa england samoa france italy georgia chinese taipei fiji australia canada portugal japan hong kong argentina south africa kenya tunisia russia uruguay ireland win eclipses refereeing errors the international rugby board may have to step in to stop frustrated coaches and players from publicly haranguing referees when things go bellyup it may have to go the whole way and have nflstyle video cameras all over the field or slap the vociferous perpetrators over the knuckles what the irb does not want is a football scenario where the verbal slanging matches often overshadow the game itself sundays explosive six nations clash at lansdowne road was a good example as ireland took another step towards their first grand slam since the game was as exciting as it comes with a muchimproved england side enraged at a few decisions that did not go their way one can understand that frustration there was no doubt that ireland had the rub of the green in their victory but the reaction from the england camp may not have endeared them to the sports blazers referee jonathan kaplan was not perfect by any means and two decisions in particular made him the villain of the piece i doubt whether kaplan would have been too pleased at the comments made after all he has no public recourse to criticism it was the same for simon mcdowell the touch judge who was heavily criticised by scotland coach matt williams after their defeat against france as far as england were concerned there were queries over mark cuetos first halfeffort when he went over in the corner from a charlie hodgson kick england coach andy robinson referred to a similar case at ravenhill in january when ulster were playing gloucester in the heineken cup on that occasion david humphreys kicked to tommy bowe who touched down in the corner only for the try to be wiped out but you cannot have cameras at every conceivable angle to pick up such anomalies perhaps robinson was right to say the referee should have gone upstairs when josh lewsey was driven over the irish line near the end lewsey claims he touched it down and was in full control however one has to credit ireland flanker johnny oconnor for cleverly scooping the ball away and blocking any evidence of a touchdown but in rugby everything tends to even out over the minutes the referee also missed englands danny grewcock taking out ronan ogara off the ball to allow martin corry a sunday stroll to the line those were the standout moments in a classic game between the two old foes but there were many more and one should not take away from those brian odriscolls winning try was as wellconceived as they come while charlie hodgsons brilliant kicking display was another highlight and ronan ogaras tremendous ability to control the game was also a crucial component but the defining moments came with ireland under the cosh in the final minutes two outstanding pieces of defensive play denied england and allowed ireland to hold on the first was denis hickies brilliant double tackle in the righthand corner he gobbled up cueto from another hodgson crossfield kick then regained his feet to stop lewsey from scoring a certain try irelands secondrow colossus paul oconnell was equally superb england had turned ireland one way then the other and the defence cordon was slowly disintegrating england prop matt stevens ran in at full steam to suck in a few more tacklers unfortunately he ran into oconnell who hit him hard very hard and then wrestled the ball away for a crucial turnover that spoke volumes about irelands backfoot display with defensive coach mike ford taking a bow at the end to win a game like that showed that ireland have moved forward it may be tries that win games but it is defence that wins championships fuming robinson blasts officials england coach andy robinson said he was livid after his side were denied two tries in sundays six nations loss to ireland in dublin mark cuetos firsthalf effort was ruled out for offside before the referee spurned tv replays when england crashed over in the dying minutes im absolutely spitting im livid theres two tries weve been cost robinson told bbc sport weve got to go back to technology i dont know why we didnt south african referee jonathan kaplan ruled that cueto was ahead of charlie hodgson when the flyhalf hoisted his crossfield kick for the sale wing to gather kaplan then declined the chance to consult the fourth official when josh lewsey took the ball over the irish line under a pile of bodies for what could have been the gamewinning try i think mark cueto scored a perfectly legal try and i think he should have gone to the video referee on josh lewsey said robinson it is how we use the technology it is there and it should be used i am still trying to work out the cueto try i have looked at both and they both looked tries we are very disappointed and this will hurt there is no doubt about that we are upset now but the referee is in charge and he has called it his way and we have got to be able to cope with that we did everything we could have done to win the game i am very proud of my players and with a couple of decisions this could have been a very famous victory i thought we dominated matt stevens had an awesome game at tighthead prop while the likes of charlie hodgson martin corry and lewis moody all came through well josh lewsey was awesome and every one of the forwards stood up out there given the pressure we were under credit must go to all the players we have done everything but win a game of rugby but ireland are a good side they defended magnificently and theyve got every chance of winning this six nations england have lost their first three matches in this years six nations and four out of their six games since robinson took over from sir clive woodward in september scotland italy six chris paterson penalties gave scotland victory in a dour but clinical encounter against italy at murrayfield coach matt williams side were outmuscled and outplayed in a tense first half but led at the break paterson slotted four more secondhalf penalties and scotland were denied a try when wing sean lamonts touchdown was ruled out for a forward pass a late andrea masi try was small consolation for italy chasing their first away win in the six nations scotland came out on top of the early exchanges and took a quick lead through the boot of fullback paterson but the more powerful azzurri pack eventually rumbled into life a series of drives into scottish territory set up a penalty attempt missed by fullback roland de marigny and a wayward dropgoal effort from luciano orquera scotland defended the initial thrusts but on minutes italy after coming up yards short of the line equalised through a de marigny penalty italy were offered another penalty when scottish flanker simon taylor was offside but the leftfooted de marigny pushed his kick wide scotland finally made the most of a rare foray into the italian half and snatched three points from paterson when an italian forward handled the ball in a ruck as the half wore on both sides squandered promising spells of momentum with sloppy penalties and the period fizzled out with scotland numerically if not psychologically on top italys de marigny narrowly missed a chance to level the scores again shortly after the break but his longrange kick shaved the right upright and scotland capitalised with a third paterson penalty on minutes williams side seemed to have found a spark from somewhere and after a couple of probing attacks paterson was able to slot another three points to widen the gap with the pendulum of possession swinging towards scotland lamont thought he had wriggled over in the left corner after minutes but play was recalled for a marginal forward pass from paterson another paterson penalty on minutes kept the pressure on the wilting visitors but john kirwans men had the last laugh when gordon ross attempted clearance was

saturdays six nations contest against scotland will be a scrappy encounter with both sides looking for their first win of the championship the thirdround game at murrayfield has been billed as a woodenspoon decider and bortolami feels the edinburgh contest could end up being a bruising battle of the packs it will not be a pretty game because both teams are desperate to gain their first win said the lock forward italy have only recorded three wins since they joined the six nations in but two of those have come against scotland this year italy opened up with a stubborn display against ireland but ended up losing however they were thoroughly outplayed by an impressive welsh side in rome last time out now the italians travel to edinburgh hoping to claim their first away win in the six nations scotland played extremely well against france in paris but not so well when ireland came to edinburgh said bortolami we are still very disappointed with our last game against wales in rome and we are thoroughly determined to right the wrongs as a nation our quest is to be respected as a team worthy of a place in this tournament and we can only do this by winning games oconnell rejects lions rumours ireland and munster lock paul oconnell has dismissed media reports linking him to the captaincy of the lions tour to new zealand this summer oconnell is rumoured to be among the frontrunners for the job but says he is totally focused on sundays six nations crunch clash with england i honestly dont think about these reports he told bbc sport the lions thing is all speculation and newspaper talk nothing more i just ignore it and get on with my job he added the only thing that annoys me after reading some reports is what the opposition locks think i can just imagine them saying im going to show this guy whats what about second row play thats the one thing that makes me cringe oconnell who made a tryscoring international debut against wales two years ago is enjoying his meteoric rise into rugbys shop window but refuses to be drawn on the lions i have spoken to sir clive woodward a few times but not for very long certainly nothing about summer holidays he joked he also said he remains wary of wounded englands abilities coming into sundays game after two straight defeats dismissing predictions of a certain irish victory its very dangerous to think that this england team has so much experience and skill you do not become a bad team overnight they have two world class gamebreakers in josh lewsey and jason robinson while charlie hodgson is just ready to click into place he insisted ireland will not make the mistake of being overconfident thats not going to happen in our squad no ireland team lining up to play england will ever fall into that trap he said every time we play england we know what a big task it is look at what they did to us two years ago i remember that game all too well and it was not a good feeling i came on as a replacement and we were losing and ended up getting hammered so i know what can happen when england come to dublin they could so easily have been coming to dublin with two wins and staring a grand slam in the face as well taylor poised for scotland return simon taylor has been named in the scotland squad for saturdays six nations clash with italy the yearold number eight made a scoring return for edinburgh at the weekend his first game in a year for the capital side taylor suffered knee ligament damage playing against ireland in dublin in the six nations championship simon is one of scotlands truly world class players so it is a huge bonus said teammate chris paterson he brings a whole new dimension to us especially in defence and his ability to slow the opposition ball down could be key against italy if he is involved taylor has turned out for english side saracens in recent weeks during a shortterm loan to improve his fitness edinburgh were not in action during the first two weeks of this seasons six nations so taylor played the last minutes of saracens win over northampton and then minutes in a friendly against south african super side the cats scotland coach matt williams is due to name his

sale vickery upbeat about arm injury england prop phil vickery is staying positive despite a broken arm ruling him out of the rbs six nations the yearold fractured the radius in his right forearm during gloucesters win over bath on saturday he will undergo an operation on monday and is expected to be out for at least six weeks he said this isnt an injury that will stop me from working hard on the fitness elements and being around the lads he added ive got the operation this afternoon and i could be back doing fitness work after a week as frustrating as it is ive got to be positive after the game vickery spoke with bath prop david barnes who also broke his arm recently i had a chat with david barnes and it looks like a similar injury to him he said he said he had the operation and he was back running after a week theres no doubt that im going to get involved and be around this place as soon as i can after the operation gloucester director of rugby nigel melville said phil has broken his radius which is the large bone in his forearm i dont really know how it happened but phil will definitely be out of action for at least six weeks i feel very sorry for him as he has been in great shape he really needed minutes of rugby this weekend and then this happened mentally it must be very hard for him dominici backs lacklustre france wing christophe dominici says france can claim another six nations grand slam despite two lacklustre wins so far against scotland and england the champions only just saw off the scots in paris then needed england to selfdestruct in last weeks win the english played better than us but lost whereas we are still in the race for the grand slam said dominici we know our display was not perfect but we can still win the grand slam along with ireland and wales france ireland and wales all remain unbeaten after two rounds of this years rbs six nations with the two celtic nations playing by far the more impressive rugby france take on wales at the stade de france on february and ireland in dublin on march but although france have yet to click dominici says that they can still win the hard way as long as scrumhalf dimitri yachvili continues in his goalkicking form if we have an efficient kicker on whom we can rely on a solid defence and a team who play for their lives we can achieve something dominici added i said at the start of the competition that the winners would be clearer from the third matches and thats exactly what is going to happen france coach bernard laporte will announce his starting lineup next tuesday for the match against wales wing jimmy marlu is definitely out with the knee injury sustained at twickenham which is likely to sideline him for the rest of the tournament inspirational flanker serge betsen is a doubt with a thigh injury but number eight imanol harinordoquy has shaken off his shoulder injury in the backs centre yannick jauzion and winger aurelien rougerie are all back in contention after injury while brive back julien laharrague has received his first callup as a replacement for pepito elhorga llewellyn plans wales retirement wales record cap holder gareth llewellyn will retire from test rugby at the end of the six nations the veteran lock who is at the end of february told bbc wales scrum v that it is time for him to bring down the curtain on his cap wales career llewellyn is on a oneseason deal with french club side narbonne but said he may consider retiring from all rugby i dont know what ill do next year whether to carry on playing or make a change in my career llewellyn said narbonne are really keen for me to stay on for next year so ive got to decide whether to stay on there or maybe go somewhere else but ultimitely coaching is where id like to end up ive done all the coaching awards and everything you can do in that respect so its just hopefully getting a chance somewhere fellow locks robert sidoli and brent cockbain who both scored tries in saturdays six nations win in italy are wales coach mike ruddocks preferred starters in the second row with the resurgence of the dragons ian gough and the adaptibility of lockcumflanker jon thomas on the bench llewellyn has not yet made a matchday squad this six nations campaign but the former neath and ospreys player is still targetting one last outing in the red shirt if i do get on the field then brilliant although the boys are doing really well and im very pleased for them llewellyn added weve had some really tough years in wales and the players have been through a hell of a lot sometimes the easiest thing would have been to throw the towel in and walk away but a few of us dug in there and its really nice to see some of the boys getting the rewards now i was going to retire at the end of the last six nations id even told some of the boys in the squad about it but mike ruddock asked me to carry on for another season which ive done still part of the squad still trying to help them out as much as i can llewellyn made his wales debut in against new zealand as a yearold having caught the selectors eyes in the all blacks tour match against neath the ft in player has not looked back since going on to break neil jenkins wales cap record on june in the loss in argentina theres been lots of highs winning the six nations in beating england in ive been on some great tours and seen some fantastic countries llewellyn said but i think the best thing of all for me was the time i spent with the players ive met some great guys in rugby and made some great friends itll be a bit strange on international days having to find somewhere to watch wales play but at least i might have time to get my golf handicap down llewellyn captained neath for seven seasons while being an integral part of the neathswansea ospreys regional sides first season but with the ospreys building for the future llewellyn was eventually forced to look to france for employment digging in his heels during contract negotiations to insist he must be allowed to play for wales wilkinson to miss ireland match england will have to take on ireland in the six nations without captain and goalkicker jonny wilkinson according to his newcastle boss rob andrew wilkinson who had targeted the february match for his international comeback has been missed by england not least for his goalkicking jonnys not fit yet falcons chief andrew told bbc radio five live he wont be fit for dublin theres no doubt about that but he might be fit for scotland and italy the yearold has not played for england since the world cup final after a succession of injuries england who have lost three six nations games in a row wasted a halftime lead in their defeat to france goalkickers charlie hodgson and olly barkley missed six penalty attempts and a dropgoal between them theyve probably got two of the best english kickers in the premiership in hodgson and barkley added andrew a former england flyhalf and goalkicker theyre both pretty good kickers charlie is a good kicker weekin weekout but its all about pressure and unfortunately england are just not handling the pressure at the moment andrew also blamed englands poor run of recent results on a lack of leadership in the side following several highprofile retirements and injuries they just didnt have that leadership that would have seen them through martin johnson lawrence dallaglio and jonny are obviously huge losses and leadership is so important in those situations he said i think it is really difficult for jason robinson to lead the side effectively from fullback meanwhile former england fullback dusty hare put englands mistakes down to a lack of mental toughness jonny wilkinson has proved himself a cool customer with around an kicking success rate hare told bbc radio five live but naturalborn toughness comes into it as well as all the practice you do you have to be able to shut out all the outside elements and concentrate on putting the ball between the posts hodgson who has an excellent kicking record with club side sale sharks has introduced crowd noise into his practice routine of late the top golfers dont hit the fairway every time and it is the same with goalkicking hare added you need that mental toughness as well to put the ball over but great goalkickers like jonny wilkinson come along very rarely italy wales wales secured their first away win in the rbs six nations for nearly four years with a sixtry victory in rome tries from jonathan thomas tom shanklin and martyn williams gave the visitors a halftime advantage luciano orquera did reply with one for italy but secondhalf efforts from brent cockbain shane williams and robert sidoli sealed victory flyhalf stephen jones added four conversions as wales maintained their superb start to this years tournament starting full of confidence after their victory over england the visitors scored the opening try after just four minutes diminutive wing shane williams fielded a kick ahead and danced past the onrushing andrea masi and aaron persico into the italian half his pass to tom shanklin appeared forward but when the centre was held up short the ball was switched left and michael owens long cutout pass gave the lurking thomas an easy runin stephen jones who retained the kicking duties despite gavin hensons heroics against england slotted an excellent conversion from wide out wales twice threatened further scores but failed to find the crucial pass and italy hit back out of the blue in the th minute henson sporting gold boots rather than the silver variety that did for england beat two players with ease out on the left touchline but his attempted chip ahead was charged down by orquera who snaffled the loose ball and hared away from halfway to score in the right corner with the welsh lineout stuttering and italy twice turning the visitors scrum the home sides forward power brought them back into it but a clever high kick from henson almost brought a try for hal luscombe when roland de marigny and ludovico nitoglia made a hash of claiming it as the ball bounced into touch wales regained control with a second try in the st minute henson lobbing up a high kick to the left corner where shanklin jumped higher than nitoglia to dot down his th test try jones was unable to convert and de marigny then hit the upright with a penalty attempt for italy henson was also narrowly short with a longrange effort at goal but wales ended the half with a vital third score to give themselves some breathing space henson sent luscombe streaking away and when he offloaded to martyn williams the flanker showed his nous to ground the ball against the padding of the post jones adding the conversion italy who lost flanker mauro bergamasco with a head knock before halftime built up a head of steam on the resumption de marigny landed a penalty to make it and a nitoglia break through the middle threatened a try only for the move to break down with a knockon but wales put the outcome beyond doubt with two superb tries in four minutes before the hour their fourth after minutes was sparked by another mazy run from shane williams who beat several players with ease and finished with a powerful angled run from lock cockbain before italy could recover from that blow a strong surge from gareth thomas and great offloads from martyn williams and replacement kevin morgan saw shane williams scamper over with jones converting both for a lead wales had the luxury of sending on five more replacements for the final quarter the icing on the cake came with a sixth try after more superb support work shane williams and ceri sweeney combining to send sidoli over in the left corner the only downside for wales was a hamstring

tindall aiming to earn lions spot bath and england centre mike tindall believes he can make this summers lions tour despite missing most of the season through injury the world cup winner has been out of action since december having damaged both his shoulder and his foot but tindall who recently signed for baths westcountry rivals gloucester told rugby special he would be fit in time for the tour to new zealand im aiming to be fit by april and hope i can play from then he said ive spoken to sir clive woodward and he understands the situation so i just hope that i can get on the tour the yearold will face stiff competition for those centre places from brian odriscoll gordon darcy and gavin henson and is aware that competition is intense but after missing out on the tour to australia with a knee injury tindall says he will be happy just to have an opportunity to wear the red shirt im quite laid back about it to be honest its quite hard for me to expect to be pushing for a test spot he said but after whats happened this season at least clive knows ill be fresh for the full interview with mike tindall tune into this sundays rugby special on bbc two oconnor aims to grab opportunity johnny oconnor is determined to make a big impression when he makes his rbs six nations debut for ireland against scotland on saturday the wasps flanker replaces denis leamy but oconnor knows that the munster man will be pushing hard for a recall for the following game against england its a horses for courses selection really said oconnor theres a lot of competition here and i cant just drag my heels around if i dont get picked it looks a definite headtohead battle between himself and yearold leamy three stone heavier than oconnor for the number seven role against the world champions nonetheless all oconnor is currently concerned about is making an impression while winning his third cap missing the italian game was disappointing certainly but you cant dwell on these things its part and parcel of rugby denis has been playing really well and deserved his opportunity its a good situation to be in if there are good players around you pushing for a place in the side oconnor who celebrated his th birthday on wednesday was touted by wasps director of rugby warren gatland as a possible lions test openside as far back as last september and his reputation as a breakdown scavenger and heavy hitter has seen him come to the forefront of osullivans mind for the scottish tussle oconnor added it will be interesting to see how situations on the deck is reffed with the new laws having come in obviously the breakdown a big part of what i do on the pitch so im hoping to hold some influence there against what is a very solid scottish pack oconnor will be winning his third cap after making his debut in the victory over south africa last november henman overcomes rival rusedski tim henman saved a match point before fighting back to defeat british rival greg rusedski at the dubai tennis championships on tuesday world number rusedski broke in the ninth game to take a tight opening set rusedski had match point at in the second set tiebreak after henman doublefaulted but missed his chance and henman rallied to clinch the set the british number one then showed his superior strength to take the decider and earn his sixth win over rusedski serve was held by both players with few alarms until the seventh game of the final set when rusedskis wild volley gave henman a vital break a furious rusedski slammed his racket onto the ground in disgust and was warned by the umpire henman seeded three then held his serve comfortably thanks to four serveandvolley winners to take a clear lead rusedski won his service game but henman took the first of his three match points with a service winner to secure his place in the second round at dubai for the first time in three years it was the first match between the pair for three years henman last lost to rusedski six years ago and lasted two hours and minutes the pair are now likely to only face each other on court as rivals rather than as teammates after henman decided to retire from davis cup tennis leaving rusedski to lead the team out against israel on march henman who now faces russian igor andreev in the last admitted afterwards it was difficult coming up against his compatriot on a fast surface you just take it point by point when youre fighting to stay in the match he said i had to keep playing aggressively and competing to get a chance i now have to recover in time for the next match because the body doesnt recover as quick as it used to especially after two hours and minutes roddick into san jose final andy roddick will play cyril saulnier in the final of the sap open in san jose on sunday the american top seed and defending champion overcame germanys tommy haas the third seed and saulnier survived an injury scare in his semifinal with seventhseeded austrian jurgen melzer the frenchman twisted his ankle early in the second set but overcame melzer who was left fuming over a series of line calls i was feeling horrible earlier in the week roddick said i thought tonight was another step in the right direction on my returns i was standing in more and im getting a little more depth even if i dont hit a perfect return roddick won the last four points of the firstset tiebreak before being broken at the start of the second set but he broke straight back and then broke haas again to lead its extremely frustrating when you have chances against a topfive player and dont do anything with them admitted haas i rushed a few backhands and he took advantage saulnier will move into the worlds top for the first time after his passage through to the final its taken a lot of work and a lot of fighting in my mind he revealed sometimes i didnt believe i could get to a final and now i am here ive stayed mentally strong im on the way ill keep fighting and work a lot and ill be up there federer forced to dig deep top seed roger federer had to save two match points before squeezing past juan carlos ferrero at the dubai open the world number one took two hours minutes to earn his victory saving match points at in the tiebreak before claiming it federer made a number of unforced errors early on allowing ferrero to take advantage and claim the first set but the swiss star hit back to reach the quarterfinals where he will face seventh seed russian mikhail youzhny the russian beat germanys rainer schuettler federer was not unduly worried despite being taken to three sets for the third consecutive match the world number one was forced to go the distance against ivan ljubicic in the rotterdam final and against ivo minar in the first round in dubai i definitely had a slow start again and to come back every time is quite an effort he said i havent been playing well but ive been coming through im winning the crucial points and that shows im on top

into the squad in tel aviv as designated hitters for team practice but bates has no plans to call either of them into his squad at present the unheralded sherwood was the surprise inclusion when the squad was announced last week and bates said david has earned his place in this squad on the merit of his form and results over the last months the ft in sherwood is ranked th in the world and the lta have high hopes for him after futures tournament wins in wrexham and edinburgh the sheffieldborn righthander aged also reached another final in plaisir france a week after making the semifinal in

of equal prize money for women reacting to a disputed comment by all england club chairman tim phillips the american said i think it is highly insulting if prize money is taken away somebody i think it was mr phillips said they wont have money for flowers at wimbledon thats insulting an all england club spokesperson denied phillips made the remark insisting he definitely didnt say it the statement added it was said by someone else and was a humorous aside at the end of a radio interview when the conversation had moved to talking about the wimbledon grounds davenport was speaking following the announcement that this weeks dubai duty free event will join the us and australian opens in offering equal prize money for women you hear about women playing only three sets while men play five said daveport and the best women are never going to beat the best men but its a different game you go to watch with the women it doesnt make it better or worse hopefully we will be able to change peoples minds serena williams who is also in dubai added im obviously for equal prize money womens tennis is exciting mens tennis is exciting as well but the women have it right now if you are bringing in the spectators you should be able to reap what everyone else is able to reap mirza shocks kuznetsova sania mirza continued her remarkable rise with victory over us open champion svetlana kuznetsova at the dubai championships on tuesday the yearold indian who is already a huge star in her home country won in front of a delirious crowd it was mirzas sixth straight victory following her first wta tournament win in hyderabad last month earlier daniela hantuchova built on her improving form with a win over sixth seed alicia molik mirza needed attention to an ankle injury after the second game against kuznetsova she quickly slipped down but staged a dramatic comeback that thrilled the large indian contingent in the crowd i really didnt expect that after my ankle turn said mirza i played a great match and i think the crowd did it again i knew that i had to play an allround game and thats what happened i did everything well but i wasnt missing the ball i dont know how that happened mirza plays silvia farina elia or jelena jankovic next hantuchova has risen from in the world at the turn of the year to number having reached the quarterfinals and semifinals at her last two events it was such a tough firstround match and i am glad to come through said hantuchova she was serving so well i just decided to hang in there and keep fighting the slovakian will meet elena likhovtseva in the second round after the russian struggled past tunisian wild card selima sfar likhovtseva needed nine match points before seeing off sfar who got a point penalty for swearing in the

for improvement in her game i started well and finished well but played some soso games in the middle she said williams was also far from content i dont know what i was doing there she said it was really windy and i hadnt played in the wind all my shots were going out of here but hantuchova is in upbeat mood ahead of her clash with the younger williams sister who was handed a firstround bye i feel i have an advantage over serena because i have already played two matches on these courts she said it is a difficult court to play on very fast and sometimes you feel you have no control over the ball murray to make cup history andrew murray will become britains youngestever davis cup player after it was confirmed he will play in the doubles against israel on saturday the yearold will play alongside fellow debutant david sherwood against israels jonathan erlich and andy ram murray will eclipse the record set by roger becker back in greg rusedski takes tim henmans place as first choice

tim henman who announced his davis cup retirement earlier this year believes britain can win the tie in tel aviv its going to be as really tough match israel have some really good players and their doubles pair of andy ram and jonathan erlich are among the top eight in the world but i fancy our chances he said but henman urged bogdanovic who has had runins with british tennis officials in the past to seize his chance alex is a quality player hes young but hes got to keep pushing forward hes got to be stronger hes got a lot of ability but hes got to be more disciplined mentally and physically and if he does that hes got a good chance venus stunned by farina elia venus williams suffered a firstround defeat for the first time in four years at the dubai championships sylvia farina elia who had lost all nine of her previous meetings with the american fifth seed won former wimbledon champion conchita martinez and indias sania mirza the oldest and youngest players in the draw also reached the second round martinez beat shinobu asagoe and yearold mirza beat jelena kostanic mirza the first indian woman to win a wta tour title this month on home ground at hyderabad will now face us open champion svetlana kuznetsova but she is remaining confident she kuznetsova is a great player she said but everyone is beatable and i am looking forward to a great match williams though blamed her defeat by farina elia on injuries blisters were a factor but mostly my stomach wasnt that great she said i did it in the last tournament in the semifinals and i was serving at in the final the first time i served again was sunday and there wasnt a lot i could do out there when your serve isnt good it throws the rest of your game off too she will wait to see how she recovers before deciding whether to take part in the nasdaq open in miami starting on march martinez sees off vinci challenge veteran spaniard conchita martinez came from a set down to beat italian roberta vinci at the qatar open in doha the wimbledon champion won to earn a second round meeting with french open champion anastasia myskina fifth seed patty schnyder also had a battle as she needed three sets to beat chinas na li slovakian daniela hantuchova beat bulgarian magdaleena maleeva to set up a second round clash with russian elena bovina the veteran martinez found herself in trouble early on against vinci with the italian clinching the set thanks to breaks in the third and th games but vincis game fell to pieces after that and martinez swept her aside with some crisp crosscourt returns and deft volleys in the days other matches japans ai sugiyama defeated australian samantha stosur while australian nicole pratt beat tunisian selima sfar and will next face compatriot alicia molik clijsters set for february return tennis star kim clijsters will make her return from a careerthreatening injury at the antwerp wta event in february kim had considered returning to action in paris on february a statement on her website said shes decided against this so that she does not risk the final phase of her recovery if all goes well kim will make her return on february the yearold has not played since last october after aggravating a wrist injury at the belgian open back then a doctor treating the belgian feared that her career may be over with the player having already endured an operation earlier in the season to cure her wrist problem i hope she comes back but im pessimistic said bruno willems clijsters was also due to marry fellow tennis star lleyton hewitt in february but the pair split for private reasons back in october hewitt falls to dent lleyton hewitt suffered a shock defeat to taylor dent in the quarterfinals of the australian hardcourt championships in adelaide on friday the top seed was a strong favourite for the title but went down to the american dent will face juan ignacio chela next after the fourth seed was too strong for jurgen melzer olivier rochus beat third seed nicolas kiefer and will take on second seed joachim johansson the swede reached the last four by beating compatriot thomas enqvist i felt like i was striking the ball much better said johansson i felt like i had a lot of break chances i didnt take care of them all but i broke him four times and he only broke me once i felt that was the key to get up in the set early angry williams rejects criticism serena williams has angrily rejected claims that she and sister venus are a declining force in tennis the sisters ended last year without a grand slam title for the first time since but serena denied their challenge was fading saying thats not fair im tired of not saying anything weve been practising hard weve had serious injuries ive had surgery and after i got to the wimbledon final i dont know many who have done that while serena is through to the australian open semifinals venus went out in the fourth round meaning she has not gone further than the last eight in her last five grand slam appearances but serena added venus had a severe strain in her stomach i actually had the same injury but i didnt tear it the way she did if i would have torn it i wouldnt have been here she played a player alicia molik that just played out of her mind and venus made some errors that she probably shouldnt have made serena also said people tended to forget the impact the murder of sister yetunde price had had on the family to top it off we have a very very very very very close family serena continued to be in some situation that weve been placed in in the past little over a year its not easy to come out and just perform at your best when you realize there are so many things that are so important so no were not declining were here i dont have to win this tournament to prove anything i know that im out here and i know that im one of the best players out here davenport dismantles young rival top seed lindsay davenport booked her place in the last of the australian open with a convincing win over nicole vaidisova of the czech republic the american had too much power for her yearold opponent breaking twice in the first set and once in the second the germanborn vaidisova rallied well at times but was unable to find a way back after falling behind in the opening set davenport who closed out with an ace plays karolina sprem in the next round i was fully expecting a tough opponent and was able to play well enough to get through it said davenport i think she hits some great shots she made some errors but probably some inexperience played a role in that but shes so young and obviously has a big game and has many many years to improve on that sprem the croatian th seed saw off russias elena likhovtseva former world number one powered her way into the fourth round with a straight sets win over anna smashnova the th seed from israel stuck with williams until in the first set before it became oneway traffic the american made unforced errors but was still good enough to romp through the contest in exactly an hour she reeled off nine straight games to finish a winner remains on course to become the first australian to win her home title since chris oneil in the th seed equalled her best performance at a grand slam event when she beat unseeded russian nadia petrova to reach the fourth round after a tough first set molik grew in confidence and won in just minutes she will now meet venus williams bring it on said the yearold i played pretty well and it was nice to get through in straight sets we were destined to meet i guess williams said referring to her match with molik it will be a huge match for her in australia i can tell shes probably very motivated by that so i need to get out there and play well beat slovakias daniela hantuchova in a rollercoaster match dementieva came through becoming the seventh russian woman to reach the last in melbourne the match lasted almost three hours and featured service breaks including three in the final set when dementieva held her nerve to seal the win she now faces after the swiss th seed beat american abigail spears french open champion received a free ride into the last after lisa raymond was forced to withdraw raymond the th seeded american was ruled out after sustaining a left abdominal muscle tear in the doubles myskina the third seed now plays frances who beat francesca schiavone of italy im extremely disappointed because i couldnt have asked to play better in my first two matches raymond said serena ends sania mirzas dream sania mirza the first indian woman to reach the third round of a grand slam tennis event has lost to womens favourite serena williams the yearold mirza who got a wild card entry into the australian open in melbourne lost to williams in the third round williams took just minutes to defeat mirza and sail into the fourth round the only other indian woman to win a match at a grand slam is nirupama vaidyanathan vaidyanathan made it to the second round of the australian open in playing the biggest match of her life mirza made little impact on williams in the early stages of the game but the teenager showed more confidence in the second set and engaged the seventhseeded williams in some well contested rallies mirza a junior wimbledon doubles title winner became the first indian woman to reach the third round of a grand slam tennis event when she beat hungarian petra mandula on wednesday im really excited i was confident but i didnt think it was going to be that easy mirza said after her second round win my aim was to win a round here when i did that i was so relieved there was no pressure tennis is not a particularly popular sport in india but a number of indians watched the live telecast of the match between mirza and williams mirza who lives in the southern indian city of hyderabad known for producing a host of top indian cricketers turned professional two years ago she says she was considered too small when she went for her first tennis classes as a sixyearold girl then finally the coach called my parents up and said the way she hits the ball ive never seen a sixyearold hit a ball like that mirza told the associated press what now for british tennis tim henmans decision to quit davis cup tennis has left the british team with a gargantuan void to fill the world number seven is tied for fourth among his countrymen for wins in the history of the tournament he has from his rubbers and great britains last davis cup win without henman came against slovenia as far back as worse could follow according to former british team member chris bailey bailey told bbc sport after tims announcement i doubt greg rusedski will be that far behind him but without their top two where does that leave british ambitions in the sports premier team event captain jeremy bates has singled out alex bogdanovic and andrew murray as potential replacements the yugoslavianborn bogdanovic though is places below henman in the world rankings and has played just two cup ties winning one and losing the other murray on the other hand is th in the current atp entry list and yet to make his cup debut but bailey does see some hope for the future he said now weve dropped down to the euroafrica zone the time was right for him to step down and let the young guys come to the fore britains next opponents israel are hardly likely to be quaking in their boots ahead of the march match against a likely trio of bogdanovic murray and the thranked arvind parmar bailey said it will be tough for gb to move up but there comes a time when our young players have to step up this was always going to be inevitable with tim and gregs growing years im confident about the future i wouldnt lay money on us getting back into the world group next year but id imagine in five years time well be competing for the major honours of those lining up to replace henman the yearold murray with four futures titles under his belt last year looks the best longterm bet murray is the one that looks likeliest to take over tims mantle said bailey he has an enormous amount of selfconfidence judging by what hes said in the past bogdanovic three years murrays senior has had a more troubled time under britains davis cup umbrella while murray has been marked out as britains golden boy bogdanovic was warned by the lawn tennis association for a lack of drive at the end of and bailey said despite that alex is clearly talented as well while arvind is another contender theyre among the guys who have experienced the intensity of davis cup tennis whether as players or on the sidelines the lta has always done an exceptional job of ensuring that now theyll finally get to play regularly in the cauldron of the cup and im confident that will springboard team gb to greater success hewitt overcomes wobble in sydney lleyton hewitt gave himself the perfect preparation for next weeks australian open with victory over ivo minar in the final of the sydney international the defending champion brushed aside the czech qualifier the australian world number three strolled to the first five games of the match but was shocked as minar won the next five the top seed was rattled but recovered to close out the set and raced to victory in exactly an hour it was a strange match momentum swings said hewitt i felt like i came out of the blocks extremely well but then he loosened up a bit when he got back to i had to try to settle down and take it up a notch and i was able to do that hewitt has now lifted the sydney title four times in the last six years it just keeps getting better and better every year hewitt said ive only played this tournament four times and ive won it four times hewitt went into the final as a shortpriced favourite to clinch his th career title after dropping only one set all week he is set to meet frenchman arnaud clement in the first round of the australian open minar ranked th in the world was forced to pull out of the australian open qualifying draw to play in his first atp final for me this was a big success said the yearold i was so nervous last night i couldnt sleep ive never played a top player before i wanted

you give your best out there you cant be too sad johansson takes adelaide victory second seed joachim johansson won his second career title with a win over taylor dent at the australian hardcourt championships in adelaide the swede was made to graft american dent surviving three break points in the fifth game of the match but johansson got the breakthrough with a sublime backhand return winner and won the second set with more ease his first tournament win was at memphis in helping him leap from th in the world rankings to number afterwards dent said he rated us open semifinalist johansson as a top contender at the australian open which starts on january i believe mens tennis is all about holding serve and if hes playing like that on his own serve i dont see how guys are going to break him said dent johansson was more restrained in his assessment i have to improve my serve if im going to go all the way in melbourne slovakia seal hopman cup success slovakia clinched the hopman cup for the second time by beating argentina in saturdays final in perth daniela hantuchova put the third seeds ahead recovering from a terrible start to beat gisela dulko dominik hrbaty who had not lost

feel a little sorry for guillermo because i get very excited whenever i play for my country i show lots of emotions and played such good tennis world number hantuchova ranked two places above dulko looked nervous as she dropped the first four games of the match dulko who had lost all three of her singles matches in the group stages grew in confidence and took the opening set in just minutes but hantuchova hit back to take the next two and the match i was so nervous because i really wanted to win for the team and for dominik as he played so well all week she said i didnt think i was playing my best but i just tried to hang in there and fight hard for every point for my country slovakia won the cup on their first appearance in when karol kucera and karina habsudova beat france dementieva

first set while losing her service once williams saved three championship points before losing the match at the victoria park tennis court its really a great start to the year no matter whether its an exhibition or not i was trying to play my best and i really did it said dementieva this will give me all the confidence before the grand slams i was trying so hard to win this tournament williams was disappointed with her display she played some nice points but it was mostly me committing unforced errors four or five errors in each game she said before the match organizers auctioned off rackets

like i had a lot of break chances i didnt take care of them all but i broke him four times and he only broke me once i felt that was the key to get up in the set early hewitt played down his defeat and insisted he is focused solely on the australian open which starts on january when youve been number one in the world for a couple of years and won a couple of slams you look at the big picture and what motivates you said hewitt thats the grand slams and melbournes as big for me as any of the four even if i dont win sydney next week its no big deal davenport puts retirement on hold lindsay

tim henman the american spent three days at the ltas annual elite performance winter camp in la manga earlier this week britain has the right attitude said connors the more involved i can be with the lta the better a shortterm arrangement is just confusing the kids will ask what am i doing there lta chief executive john crowther added the relationship that jimmys already started to develop with the coaches and the players has said to us that wed like some more of it we want to use jimmy for a number of weeks a year and we hope this is the beginning of a good longterm relationship the camp played host to more than leading senior and junior players including greg rusedski arvind parmar and anne keothavong la manga is an amazing site to take a bunch of kids who want to be the best said connors speaking at queens club in london what impressed me most was not only the coaches but the way the kids went about their workouts and the feeling they put into every practice they had it was interesting to me to see kids of with that desire and passion and that can only be brought about by the coaches surrounding them instilling the importance of work and practice is something you cant buy they know whats been given to them and all they have to do is give back the effort and every minute of practice they were doing that speaking from la manga lta performance director david felgate told bbc sport jimmy was fantastic with the players and the coaches and very humble considering what hes achieved he worked through the coaches and hopefully it will grow and hell get to have more of an individual relationship with some of the players and get to know them he made it clear from the word go he didnt want it to be shortterm this is a weekayear job for me its my life and my passion and its the same with the coaches he respects that but he wants to be involved and have real input and why would he stake his reputation on something thats not going to be successful connors has also

positive i still have a few weeks she said my body has to get accustomed again to the stress the rhythm heninhardenne slid down the world rankings in the second half of after contracting the illness in april after an initial layoff she was forced off the circuit for a second time after being knocked out of the french open in the second round a comeback at the us open after a threemonth absence ended when she crashed out at the fourthround stage but despite her problems she still won five of the nine official tournaments she entered in and won olympic gold in athens an achievement which saw her named belgian sportswoman of the year on friday physically its obvious that i hit rock bottom said the yearold who will make her comeback in the sydney international from january since april with the exception of the olympics i have not done much all the successes i had prior to that were mainly due to the work i put in on building up my fitness now its time to get back to putting in effort and i think i am capable of doing that moya clinches cup for spain spain won the davis cup for the second time in their history when carlos moya beat the usas andy roddick in the fourth rubber in seville moya won to give the hosts an unassailable lead with only one singles rubber remaining roddick battled hard and had chances in the second set but moyas claycourt expertise proved the difference mardy fish beat tommy robredo in the final dead rubber to cut spains winning margin to spains only other davis cup title came in when they beat australia in barcelona this time they chose to play the final in seville and the citys olympic stadium was revamped to allow for a record crowd for a competitve tennis event of spectators and the home fans gave vociferous support to their players with yearold nadal and moya winning both fridays singles rubbers american twins mike and bob bryan gave the visitors hope with victory over juan carlos ferrero and tommy robredo in saturdays doubles but it remained an uphill task for a us team far happier on hard courts than clay and french open champion moya had too much for world number two roddick this has been incredible the moment ive been waiting for for years said moya who missed out in through injury ive prepared myself for this day i knew that playing on clay i would have my chances to win the davis cup is my dream i cant ask for more there is nothing bigger than what ive lived today moya stormed into a lead on his way to taking the first set against roddick and recovered immediately from dropping serve in the second the match came down to two tiebreaks and moya dominated both clinching victory on his third match point wild celebrations followed with an emotional moya congratulated by his teammates including nadal who at years and days becomes the youngest ever victor in davis cup history i think we put up a better fight here than in paris two years ago said roddick who was on the us team which lost to france in the semifinals at roland garros they were just better than us this weekend i have nothing to be ashamed of i gave it my all i am not going to walk out of here with my head down thats for sure theres no miracle answer we have to improve capriati to miss melbourne jennifer capriati has become the third leading lady to withdraw from the australian open because of injury the organisers of the first grand slam of which begins on january said the american has a problem with her right shoulder it comes as a blow to the womens draw as last years champion justin heninhardenne and runnerup kim clijsters will also be absent capriati is a twotime champion in melbourne with wins in and she is believed to have picked up the injury at the advanta championships at philadelphia in november and had to pull out of an exhibition match with wimbledon champion maria sharapova on december capriati also decided against competing in the australian open warmup event the sydney international moya emotional after davis cup win carlos moya described spains davis cup victory as the highlight of his career after he beat andy roddick to end the usas challenge in seville moya made up for missing spains victory through injury by beating roddick to give the hosts an unassailable lead i have woken up so many nights dreaming of this day said moya all my energy has been focused on today what i have lived today i do not think i will live again spains only other davis cup title came two years ago in valencia when they beat australia and moya nicknamed charly admitted the davis cup is my dream and i was a bit nervous at the outset some people have said that i am obsessed but i think that it is better this way it helps me reach my goals if i am obsessed its really incredible to get the winning point is really something spanish captain jordi arrese said charly played a great game it was his opportunity and he hasnt let us down he had lost three times to roddick and this was his day to beat him he had been waiting years to be in this position spains victory was also remarkable for the performance of rafael nadal who beat roddick in the opening singles aged years and days the mallorcan became the youngest player to win the davis cup what a great way to finish the year said nadal afterwards us coach patrick mcenroe wants roddick and the rest of his team to play more tennis on clay and hone their skills on the surface i think it will help these guys even on slow hard courts to learn how to mix things up a little bit and to play a little bit smarter and tactically better obviously its unrealistic to say that were going to just start playing constantly on clay with the schedule but certainly i think we can put the work in at the appropriate time and play a couple more events and play against these guys who are the best on this stuff said mcenroe roddick was left frustrated after losing both his singles on the slow clay of sevilles olympic stadium its just tough because i felt like i was in it the whole time against one of the top three claycourters in the world said the american i had my chances and just didnt convert them the bottom line is they were just better than us this weekend they came out took care of business and they beat us its as simple as that moya emotional at davis cup win carlos moya described spains davis cup victory as the highlight

federer nice bloke fantastic tennis player the ultimate sportsman when lleyton hewitt shook his hand after getting another thrashing a third in as many months the australian said youre the best how right he is the stats speak for themselves titles from finals during three of them grand slams and final victories in a row going back to vienna thats an openera record hewitt at times in houston showed form which easily matched his grand slamwinning efforts of and but he was outplayed twice hewitt along with andy roddick and marat safin is sure to be prominent during but realistically all three will be fighting for the world number two ranking according to all those players and even federer himself the swiss star is in a different league right now i feel that a little bit he told bbc sport ive dominated all the top ten players they say nice things about me because i have beaten them all i am dominating the game right now and i hope it continues the number one player in the world is also the main man for promoting the sport off court he has just been voted by the international tennis writers as the best ambassador for tennis on the atp tour he has time for everyone every match from first round to final is followed by a series of press interviews in three languages english french and swissgerman after a major win there are extra requests obligations and interviews all seen through to the end with courtesy and most importantly good humour you guys are funny i have a good time with you guys he said genuinely happy to talk into yet another tape recorder i see you pretty much every day on the tour so to give away an hour for interviews is really no problem for me if i can promote tennis and the sport then that is good for me people say thanks back and that is nice what a refreshing attitude from someone who could easily dominate the sports pages for a decade it sums up his modest personality shortly after collecting a waterford crystal trophy a mercedes convertible and a tasty cheque for m federer addressed the houston crowd and concluded by saying thanks for having me now he just needs to find a way of winning the french open the one grand slam to so far elude him clijsters hope on aussie open kim clijsters has denied reports that she has pulled out of januarys australian open because of her persistent wrist injury open chief paul mcnamee had said kims wrist obviously isnt going to be rehabilitated but her spokesman insisted she had simply delayed submitting her entry the doctors are assessing her injury on a weekly basis and if there is no risk she could play but if theres the least risk she will stay away despite being absent from the wta entry list for the tournament which begins on january clijsters would be certain to get a wild card if she requested one clijsters is still ranked nd in the world despite only playing a handful of matches last season the belgian had an operation on her left wrist early in the season but injured it again on her return to the tour meanwhile jelena dokic who used to compete for australia has opted out of the first grand slam of the season dokic has not played in the australian open since when she lost in the first round but the yearold would have had to rely on a wild card next season because her ranking has tumbled to th fourtime champion monica seles who has not played since last years french open is another absentee because of an injured left foot edgy agassi struggles past dent andre agassi put in an erratic display before edging into the fourth round of the australian open with victory over taylor dent the yearold american seeded eighth made a poor start dropping serve early on and later needing two chances to serve out the set having secured the lead agassi still failed to take control as both players forced a succession of breaks but agassi won the tiebreak before wrapping up a win fourth seed survived an injury scare as he battled past mario ancic the russian turned his right ankle in the third game of the fourth set and called for treatment immediately but he showed no sign of the problem when he returned to the court to wrap up victory in two hours minutes ancic wimbledon semifinalist in looked set to push safin all the way when he took the second set but safin raised his game to sink the croatian safin said he was trying to keep his temper under control at this years tournament the russian hit himself on the head repeatedly in one secondset outburst but was otherwise largely calm in his victory i try to stay calm because if you go crazy against players like ancic you might never come back because hes a tough opponent he said im a little bit calmer than i was before because id had enough the russian added that he was not worried by his ankle injury i have had a lot of problems with that ankle before it will be ok he said s route to the fourth round was made easy when opponent jarkko nieminen was forced to retire from their match the top seed and defending champion was leading when nieminen pulled out with an abdominal injury federer had been in patchy form until then mixing unforced errors with winners the world number one will play cypriot next after the former world junior champion beat tommy robredo federer admitted he was under extra pressure after extending his winning streak to a careerbest they are so used to me winning but its not that simple he said i had a feeling this could be a tough match i had a bad start but i bounced back i always want to play better than i am but i thought i was pretty ok french open champion is out of the tournament after a fiveset defeat by dominik hrbaty hrbaty defeated the th seed in a match lasting four hours and minutes the pair traded service breaks during an exhausting baseline battle with hrbaty taking a decisive advantage in the eighth game of the final set hrbaty will now play champion who outlasted american kevin kim roddick splits from coach gilbert andy roddick has ended an month association with coach brad gilbert which yielded the us open title and saw the american become world number one roddick released a statement through the sfx sports group with the news but did not give a reason for the split the decision to not rehire brad gilbert for the season is based on what i think is best for my game at this time said roddick any more on this situations a private matter between coach and player roddick won of his matches while working with gilbert and said he had enjoyed their time together he won his first grand slam event at flushing meadows last year and finished on top of the atp tour rankings but roddick slipped to second this year behind roger federer who became the first man since to win three majors in a season federer who has not had a coach since he split from peter lundgren at the end of last year beat roddick to win the wimbledon title and in two other tournament finals roddick hired gilbert after deciding to part from coach tarik benhabiles in the wake of his firstround exit at the french open he went on to win the us open and four other titles for the year he has won four events this season i have enjoyed all of my time with andy gilbert said on his personal website he has been a great student of the game during the time that we worked together and i am very proud of the results that were achieved while i believe that there is still a great deal of work to be done andy clearly does not feel that way roddick in talks over new coach andy roddick is reportedly close to confirming us davis cup assistant dean goldfine as his new coach roddick ended his month partnership with brad gilbert on monday and goldfine admits talks have taken place we had a really good conversation and were on the same page in terms of what i expect from a player in commitment and what he wants said goldfine the reading i got from him is that i would have a lot of the qualities hes looking for in a coach speaking to told south floridas sunsentinel newspaper goldfine added that being said from his standpoint which is smart he wants to cover all his bases i think andy wants a longterm relationship and wants to make sure its the right fit the best fit goldfine has worked with todd martin and roddicks close friend mardy fish and was an assistant coach with the us olympic team martin is the other name to have been linked to the vacant post alongside roddick hewitt survives nalbandian epic home favourite lleyton hewitt came through a dramatic fiveset battle with argentine david nalbandian to reach the australian open semifinals hewitt looked to be cruising to victory after racing into a twoset lead but nalbandian broke his serve three times in both of the next two sets to set up a nailbiting decider hewitt eventually grabbed the vital break in the th game and served out to win and set up a meeting with andy roddick the winner of that match will face either roger federer or marat safin in the final ninth seed nalbandian had never come back from two sets down to win a match and there was no indication he would do so as hewitt dominated the first two sets the argentine had stoked up the temperature ahead of the match by saying hewitts exuberant oncourt celebrations were not very good for the sport and he had words with hewitt during one change of ends in the second set when the australian appeared to brush shoulders with him as they went to their chairs the balance of power changed completely in the third set as hewitt allowed his level to dip and he doublefaulted twice as nalbandian broke on the way to taking the fourth set but the tiring third seed showed incredible reserves of strength to force the break despite being outplayed for much of the final set and three times coming within two points of defeat he then produced a love service game to finish off the match in four hours and five minutes i just kept hanging in there it was always tough serving second in the fifth set said hewitt who had never reached the last four at his home grand slam i told myself to give everything and in the end it paid off once again its a long way from holding that trophy up there but im hanging in there only four guys left that can win and were the top four in the world its set up for a pretty good showdown in the semis and finals sydney return for heninhardenne olympic champion justine heninhardenne will return to action in januarys sydney international tournament the belgian has not competed since losing her top world ranking at the us open in september where she was beaten in the fourth round by nadia petrova she took time out to shake off a virus but will defend her titles in sydney and at the australian open womens world number one lindsay davenport and french open champion anastasia myskina will also compete in the mens event world number three lleyton hewitt returns to defend his title along with runnerup carlos moya moya spains davis cup final hero in their recent win over the us had to retire with an ankle injury in the first set of the final tournament director craig watson said i had a message relayed to me from him after spains davis cup victory saying he was looking forward to trying to make up for his disappointment in the final the tournament will take place from january hewitt fights back to reach final lleyton hewitt kept his dream of an australian open title alive with a fourset win over andy roddick in fridays second semifinal the home favourite will face marat safin in sundays final after coming through hewitt fought back from a set down and trailed in both tiebreaks but would not be denied thrilling the melbourne crowd with a typically battling effort he is aiming to be the first australian winner since mark edmondson in hewitt is the first australian to make the final since pat cash lost to mats wilander in but faces a huge challenge against safin the conqueror of roger federer after needing five sets in his last two matches there was reason to think hewitt might struggle for fitness he certainly made a sluggish start dropping his opening service game and roddick dominated with his huge serve as he took the first set after tense games in the second the key moment came when hewitt raised his game in the tiebreak to overturn an early minibreak that energised the crowd but roddick was not finished and raced clear in the crucial third before hewitt pegged him back and forced another tiebreak again roddick broke first and again hewitt fought back taking the lead with a superb backhand pass the australian was not to be denied and a disheartened roddick made little impact in the fourth set as hewitt raced to victory sending the melbourne crowd wild and ensuring the final will be a huge occasion its awesome said hewitt i started preparing for this tournament nine months ago ive done a lot of hard yards to get here ive always said id do anything to get in the first night final at the australian open now ive got my chance roddick was furious with himself for failing to take advantage of leads in both tiebreaks im usually pretty money in those said roddick either one of those would have given me a distinct advantage im mad i felt i was in there with a shot he put himself in position to win big points i donated a little more than i would have wanted and the american played down the influence of one spectator who appeared to contribute to a double fault by shouting during rodicks service action it just took one jackass to shout out said roddick adding that the crowd overall was very respectful officials respond in court row australian tennis top official has defended the australian open courts at melbourne park after criticism of the playing surface by lleyton hewitt hewitt said he had had a gutful of trying to persuade them to make the surface faster but tennis australias geoff pollard rejected his comments we did ask for it to be made faster than last year and to my knowledge it is faster he said we spent a substantial amount of money on modifications to make it faster hewitt who has not got past the fourth round at melbourne in seven attempts had earlier said the surface was not worthy of such a prestigious tournament but he said he would play on whatever surface he had to in order to have a chance of winning the tournament starts on january and pollard said the surface had been speeded up since last years tournament following complaints by several australian players but he refused to accept that the melbourne surface may have had a bearing on hewitts performances over the years lleytons proving how versatile he is on all surfaces he said it is faster than last year and thatll be faster than the one lleyton beat roger federer on in the davis cup in williams battles to aussie title serena williams staged a remarkable recovery to beat lindsay davenport and win her second australian open title the champion claimed her seventh grand slam title and her first since wimbledon in williams had looked close to quitting with a rib injury when she left the court for treatment after five games she quickly dropped the first set but from in the second found another gear as davenports game collapsed allowing williams to take the title williams later explained her injury problem saying it was the result of lunging for a ball early in the first set lindsay had me on the run out wide on my backhand and my back went but eventually i was able to come back thank goodness she said davenport paid tribute to williams saying shes had a tough couple of years and shes come back like a champion the yearold former world number one was in desperate trouble in the early stages as the injury hampered her service action davenport took advantage to race through the opening set and held six break points in game five of the second i kept thinking to myself im not losing this game said williams afterwards i dont care if my arm falls off im not losing this game and i guess thats what happened i didnt want to lose that particular game because it would have given her a lot of momentum and a lot of confidence despite letting the break points slip away davenport looked comfortable enough at but from up she just folded williams won nine consecutive points for the set and powered through the decider as a lacklustre davenport looked to have run out of energy after a gruelling two weeks i felt like i was playing well and in control pretty much of the match said davenport then i just had that horrible lapse i think serving up and made a few errors and opened up the door for her and she just kept going through it at the end i think i was a little bit fatigued but she took advantage of it and kept going shes a great frontrunner when she gets going safin cool on wimbledon newlycrowned australian open champion marat safin has ruled out any chance of winning wimbledon in the future after losing in round one last year safin said he had given up on wimbledon and winning his second grand slam title has not changed his mind ill play but with no expectations i feel like i cant waste my time my energy on that surface he said some people they cannot play on clay some people they cannot play on a hard court me i cant play on grass however safin is hopeful that winning the australian open will give him the belief he needs to win more grand slam titles its a relief for me two grand slams its already something but with this one i worked really hard for it he said basically i would love to win a couple more i think i have a chance if i continue this way if coach peter lundgren will stick around with me and wants to work with me for a bit longer i think i can make it the yearold shocked pete sampras in the us open final to win his first major title but then lost in two australian open finals safin admitted he had begun to doubt whether he would win another grand slam i didnt expect that to win the us open it was against sampras i wasnt the favourite so i had no pressure whatsoever he said after the first final that i didnt win against thomas johansson in i couldnt see myself winning the grand slams anymore i was once in the semifinals of the french open but i didnt believe i can win it i just couldnt handle the pressure you need to believe in yourself and i didnt and after losing the first set to lleyton hewitt in sundays final safin said he began to doubt himself again i am im playing against hewitt at least you have to have the opportunity to win it at least have a chance he said its like you go there and you lose first set then you start to think this is not my day the way im playing is ridiculous but then you start to really be a little bit more selfish and try to find a way out of there and i found it i was like really much i was much happier than in thats for sure because i get over it nadal puts spain up result nadal roddick spains rafael nadal beats andy roddick of the usa in the second singles match rubber of the davis cup final in seville spain lead after carlos moya beat mardy fish in straight sets in the opening match of the tie nadal holds his nerve and the crowd goes wild as spain go up in the tie roddick holds serve to force nadal to serve for the match but the american surely cannot turn things around now nadal works roddick around the court on two consecutive points to earn two break points one is enough the spaniard secures the doublebreak and roddick is now teetering on the edge roddick is trying to gee himself up but the clay surface is taking its toll on his game and he is looking tired nadal wins the game to love nadal steps up the pressure to break and spain have the early initiative in the fourth set nadal also holds convincingly as both players feel their way into the fourth set roddick shrugs off the disappointment of losing the thirdset tiebreak and breezes through his first service game of the fourth set nadal earns the first minibreak in the tiebreak as the match enters its fourth hour a couple of stunning points follow one where nadal chases down a roddick shot and turns into a passing winner then roddick produces some amazing defence at the net to take the score to roddick has two serves for the set but doublefaults to take the score to nadal saves a roddick set point then earns his own with a drive volley and a crosscourt passing winner sends the crowd wild nadal tries to up his aggression and he passes roddick down the line to go and two set points up roddick saves the first with a desperate lunge volley and smacks a volley winner across the court to take the score back to deuce before securing the game the set will go to another tiebreak nadal enjoys another straightforward hold and roddick must once again serve to stay in the set roddick again holds on despite some brilliant shotmaking from his opponent nadal races through his service game to put the pressure straight back onto roddick roddick hangs in on his serve to level matters but nadal is making him fight for every point nadal could be suffering a disappointment hangover from the previous game as he goes down and then has to save a break point after a tremendous rally in which he is forced into some brilliant defence but it pays off and the spaniard edges ahead in the set roddicks serve is not firing as ferociously as usual and has to rely on his sheer competitive determination to stay in the set three times nadal forces a break point and three times the world number two hangs in and roddicks grit pays off as he manages to hold roddick still looks a bit sluggish but he attacks the net and is rewarded with a break point which nadal saves with a good first serve and the spaniard goes on to hold there is a disruption in play as roddick is upset about something in the crowd the spanish captain gets involved as does the match referee but it is unclear what the problem is one thing for certain is that the crowd are roused into support of nadal and they go wild when roddick loses the next point and goes break point down roddick saves the break point and then bangs down his ninth ace before clinching the game with a service winner the game passes the twohour mark as nadal holds serve to edge ahead in the third set now roddick has to defend a break point and he produces a characteristic ace to save it it is immediately followed by another and he holds with a little dinked halfvolley winner roddick is looking a little leadenfooted but does carve out a break point for himself but he plays it poorly and nadal avoids the danger roddick has gone off the boil and again struggles he fails to get down properly for a low forehand volley and gives nadal three break points the american blasts an ace to save one but follows up with a double fault and the rubber is level nadal edges towards taking the second set with a comfortable hold two good serves put roddick up but he then makes a couple of errors to find himself down he saves the break point with an ace and then manages to hold roddicks level has dropped while nadal is on a hot streak the spaniard includes a superb crosscourt winner off the back foot as he races through his service game without dropping a point roddick doublefaults twice and nadal takes full advantage of the break point offered powering a passing winner past roddick nadal wins another tight game neither player has dipped from the high standard of play in the first set nadal puts the american under pressure and roddick saves a break point with a superb stop volley before going on to hold nadal puts the disappointment of losing the firstset tiebreak to claim the opening game in the second roddick doublefaults to concede the first minibreak and then nadal loops a crosscourt winner to seize advantage in the tiebreak he lets one slip but wins his next serve to earn three set points but roddick saves them and then earns one himself nadal comes up with a downtheline winner but then nets tamely on roddicks next set point nadals nerve is tested as he tries to force a tiebreak both players come up with some scintillating tennis and the spaniard has several chances to clinch the game before finally doing so when roddick drives wide a pulsating game sees nadal racing round the court retrieving and refusing to give roddick any easy points the point of the match so far involves roddicks slamdunk smash being returned by nadal before roddick finally manages to end the rally on the very next point nadal blasts a forehand service return from right of court that passes roddick and even the american is forced to applaud but roddick comes up with two big serves to polish off the game nadal outplays roddick to reach but the american fights back to before nadals powerful crosscourt forehand winner secures the game the crowd are getting very involved cheering between roddicks first and second serves but the american comes through to hold and edge ahead in the set nadal manages to hold again despite roddick piling the pressure on his serve the spaniard wins the game courtesy of another lucky net cord roddick double faults buts manages to keep his composure a wellplaced serve is unreturnable and roddick holds a powerful ace down the middle gives nadal a simple love service game the first time he has held serve so far in the match if roddick didnt know before he knows now that he is in a real contest another superb game as nadal breaks to once again lift the roof he produces some fine groundstrokes to leave roddick chasing shadows four of the first five games have seen a break of serve despite the disappointment of losing his serve roddick is not phased and storms into a lead when the umpire leaves his seat to confirm a close linecall nadal takes the next point but roddick breaks again with a sharp volley at the net roddicks advantage is short lived as nadal breaks back immediately a fortunate net cord helps the spaniard on his way and when roddick fires a forehand cross court shot wide to lose his serve nadal pumps his fist in celebration the american is pumped up for this clash and takes on nadals serve from the start nadals drop shot is agonisingly called out and roddick claims the vital first break after moyas win in the opening rubber a raucous seville crowd is buoyed by nadals impressive start which sees him race into a lead however roddick fights back to hold his serve henman murray claim lta awards tim henman was named player of the year for by the lawn tennis association at wimbledon on monday the briton was recognised for the best year of his career which saw him reach the semis at the french and us opens scotlands andrew murray was named young player of the year after winning the us open juniors as well as a futures event in italy and world number one peter norfolk won disabled player of the year after claiming his third us open crown great britains under boys won the team of the year prize for their victory at the world junior tennis event in august henman will start his campaign at the kooyong event on january in a field that includes roger federer andy roddick and andre agassi and the briton is optimistic of surpassing his best effort of a fourthround place at the australian open which begins the following week ive often felt that the conditions suit my game in melbourne so id love to be able to start next year by doing well at the australian open henman told his website thats why ive changed my schedule slightly by committing to play in the kooyong classic ill be able to acclimatise while practising before the event and then will be guaranteed matches against the best players in the world i think that will give me the best possible chance of doing well at the australian open connors rallying cry for british tennis do you have it in your heart how much guts do you have how much do you hate to lose these are the questions jimmy connors will be asking of britains brightest tennis hopes in the months and possibly years to come the american legend swept into london on thursday to announce a longterm relationship with the lawn tennis association after spending three days at the elite performance winter camp in la manga and the man who epitomised the phrase will to win before lleyton hewitt was even born is clear about the qualities he hopes to convey you know everybody hits the ball well and theres a very fine line between number one and number said connors i was that fine line for a long time but if i can help i want to be part of teaching kids how to win connors is not the first great name to offer his services to the lta his longtime rival john mcenroe has repeatedly done the same but connors is at pains to point out that his interest goes well beyond any publicity stunt and he gave a glowing recommendation to the work of lta performance director david felgate and his team britain has a different attitude the right attitude in taking the game forward and finding the next wimbledon champion said connors thats something you dont find every day everybody talks a good game but not everybody puts that into effect the impression i came away with after just seeing david and the other coaches for three days was one like ive never seen before especially over here this is not going to happen overnight there are no miracle workers but youre going in the right direction the yearolds enthusiasm for the work going on in this country is in marked contrast to his relationship with tennis officials back in america ive had discussions with the usta united states tennis association over a number of years he said thats where it my input ended connors is a straighttalker and will be equally blunt and honest in his dealings with the lta and the cream of britains young players if theyre chosen theyve got to produce he said if not someone will come and take their place theres only one number one spot and its lonely up there but its got the best view in the year that has seen andrew murray emerge as britains great new hope connors rejected suggestions that the scot might be put under too much pressure too soon tim henman has a whole country on his shoulder said connors i dont know that pressure but if you like that it can be a certain push to get on to the next level someones going to have to come and take over from him henman if i was andrew murray id embrace that thats what we play for despite the emphasis on hard work training and preparation connors does admit that the desire required of a champion has to come from within the passion i had i dont know if you can find that he admitted i was also nuts i say that because there was nothing better for me than to compete on the tennis court it was the most important thing in the world for me and to do that somethings got to be not right with you there was nothing better for me ever than to play tennis in front of people what i had when i played tennis is what i am you have to have that you cant be moulded roche turns down federer offer australian tennis coach tony roche has turned down an approach from roger federer to be the world number ones new fulltime coach say reports melbournes heraldsun said roche troubled by a hip complaint did not want to travel fulltime again however roche is happy to work with the swiss star on a casual basis and is helping him prepare for next months defence of his australian open crown federer has been without a coach since splitting with peter lundgren in roche a former davis cup player for australia won the french open reached the wimbledon and us open finals and won five wimbledon doubles titles with john newcombe he also coached former number one ivan lendl and pat rafter to grand slam victories and has worked with australias lleyton hewitt some reports claim federer initially wanted andre agassis australian coach darren cahill before agassi confirmed he would play on in federer was named swiss sportsman of the year on saturday to add to the bbc overseas sportsman and european sports journalists association awards he has already won federer joins alltime greats the last year has seen one player dominate mens tennis and one country dominate the womens game roger federer became the first man since mats wilander in to win three grand slams in one season and after anastasia myskina became the first russian woman to win a grand slam at the french open two more followed at wimbledon and the us open meanwhile briton tim henman enjoyed his best year while greg rusedski fought back superbly from adversity federer began the year as world number one and holder of the wimbledon and masters cup titles and set about conquering new ground the swiss sounded warning of the dominance to come at the australian open he ripped through the draw before beating marat safin in the final andy roddick was the only player to put up any real resistance at wimbledon and federers performance against lleyton hewitt in the us open final was breathtaking federer again got the better of hewitt in the seasonending masters cup his victory in houston proved to be his th successive win in a final an open era record the only major letdown was a thirdround loss to gustavo kuerten at the french open and roland garros will be his main target in there was also a surprise loss to the unheralded tomas berdych at the olympic games which saw chile dominate as nicoals massu took the singles and then paired up with fernando gonzaelz to win doubles gold another major trophy that looks beyond federer is the davis cup which was won by spain in a home success over the usa in seville roddick struggled on the clay losing to rafael nadal on the opening day before going down to carlos moya in the allimportant fourth rubber henman broke new ground by reaching the semis on clay at the french open a stunning effort and also at the us open a quarterfinal defeat to mario ancic at wimbledon was disappointing for the limp manner of the britons defeat but he remains optimistic of going further next year british number two rusedski endured a rollercoaster year returning to the circuit after being cleared of a doping offence in march with his ranking down at many feared the yearolds career was over but he battled back in the second half of the season to reenter the top the russian women finally delivered on their longrecognised promise in with myskina maria sharapova and svetlana kuznetsova winning grand slams before taking the seasonending fed cup but while the young russians were on the way up it was a different story for the belgians and the williams sisters only veteran lindsay davenport held the new wave at bay a stunning run of form after wimbledon taking her to number one ahead of amelie mauresmo whose grand slam drought goes on the year started in regulation fashion as justine heninhardenne beat compatriot kim clijsters at the australian open a virus ruined the rest of heninhardennes year although she was fit enough to win olympic gold but clijsters had an even more miserable she suffered a serious wrist injury and then announced the end of her relationship with lleyton hewitt and will be happy to see the year end in their absence myskina thrashed elena dementieva in a historic but woeful allrussian final at the french open wimbledon was a more refreshing affair as sharapova captivated sw showing nerves of steel as she battled past davenport and serena williams to take the title davenport was a strong favourite for the us open but hampered by injury lost to the powerful and unflappable kuznetsova in the semis kuznetsova went on to give dementieva another grand slam final thrashing with the latters wayward serve becoming one of the talking points of the year with the russians still improving the likes of heninhardenne clijsters davenport mauresmo venus and serena will need to be fully fit and motivated in and it may take their compatriot safin to challenge federer on the mens side philippoussis doubt over open bid mark philippoussis is almost certain to miss the australian open after suffering a groin injury during the hopman cup loss to the netherlands the yearold suffered two tears to the adductor muscle and was unable to play in the deciding mixed doubles he is now unlikely to be fit in time for the australian open which begins on january in melbourne he has to strengthen it enough to cope with repetitive days of tennis said hopman cup doctor hamish osborne it would be very unlikely in my opinion for him to do a fivesetter once let alone two days in a row inside two weeks the injury is more common in australian rules football and a fit footballer would normally take three to four weeks to recover fully although marks injury is slightly different the australian has suffered a host of injury problems throughout his career but is still holding out slim hope that he can make the event its something ill have to go by feel ill start treatment as soon as possible and try to strengthen it without tearing it any more he said what doesnt kill you makes you stronger i know i can come back from this and thats all that matters former world number two tommy haas is also a doubt for the australian open after picking up a thigh injury playing for germany in the hopman cup the yearold had treatment on his left thigh while leading argentine guillermo coria he played one more game but his movement was hampered and he quit slovakia reach hopman cup final slovakia will play argentina in the final of the hopman cup after beating group b rivals the netherlands daniela hantuchova defeated michaella krajicek to give the slovaks the perfect start before dutchman peter wessels retired against dominik hrbaty wessels was unable to compete in the mixed doubles but slovakia had already booked their place in the final for the second year running argentina claimed top spot in group a with three wins from three matches in the other group b match the united states defeated australia meghann shaughnessy lost the opening match against alicia molik but james blake levelled the tie with a win over paul baccanello who came in as a replacement for the injured mark philippoussis blake and shaughnessy then beat molik and baccanello in a tense mixed doubles contest to take the win hantuchova who did not win a hopman cup singles match in has been in good form during this years event and has won two of her three matches i feel like its really deserved this time as ive helped dominik to get through she said i think if i keep going the way i have been in the past few matches then i will be okay i was really pleased with my last two singles even the first one which was a really high standard you cant ask for a better preparation than to play a few matches here for the australian open dent continues adelaide progress american taylor dent reached the final of the australian hardcourt event in adelaide with a crushing win over argentine juan ignacio chela dent will meet swede joachim johansson on sunday after the second seed survived a tense tiebreak to defeat belgiums olivier rochus johansson the boyfriend of lleyton hewitts sister jaslyn received strong crowd support on saturday it feels like home for me because jaslyn lives here said johansson rochus was leading in the second set tiebreak but his concentration was ruffled by a disputed line call and the match slipped away it was so close one mistake like this and the match is over its tough for me it was clearly out rochus said minister digs in over doping row the belgian sports minister at the centre of the svetlana kuznetsova doping row says he will not apologise for making allegations against her claude eerdekens claims the us open champion tested positive for ephedrine at an exhibition event last month criticised for making the announcement he said i will never apologise this product is banned and its up to her to explain why its there kuznetsova says the stimulant may have been in a cold remedy she took the russian said she did nothing wrong by taking the medicine during the event the womens tennis association cleared kuznetsova of any offence because the drug is not banned when taken out of competition eerdekens said he made the statement in order to protect the other three players that took part in the tournament belgian justine heninhardenne nathalie dechy of france and russias elena dementieva but dechy is fuming that she has been implicated in the row how can you be happy when you see your face on the cover page and talking about doping dechy said im really upset about it and i think the belgian government did a really bad job about this i think we deserve an apology from the guy you cannot say anything like this you cannot say some stuff like this saying its one of these girls this is terrible dementieva is also angry and says that dechy and herself are the real victims of the scandal you have no idea what i have been through all these days its been too hard on me she said the wta are trying to handle this problem by saying there are three victims but i see only two victims in this story me and nathalie dechy who really have nothing to do with this to be honest with you i dont feel like i want to talk to sveta at all im just very upset with the way everything has happened veteran martinez wins thai title conchita martinez won her first title in almost five years with victory over annalena groenefeld at the volvo womens open in pattaya thailand the yearold spaniard came through for her first title since berlin in it feels really good said martinez who is playing her last season on the tour to come through like that in an important match feels good its been nearly five years and i didnt think i could do it groenefeld was the more powerful player but could not match her opponents relentless accuracy it was my first final a new experience said the german i think she played a good match a tough match but i tried to stay in there i think the whole week was good for me rusedski forced out in marseille greg rusedski was forced to withdraw from the open in marseille on thursday with a rib injury the british number two had been scheduled to play qualifier sebastien de chaunac who beat world number five guillermo coria in round one but rusedski was unable to take to the court because of a problem with the lefthand side of his ribcage american taylor dent caused a shock with a victory over second seed david nalbandian but third seed joachim johansson made it through after beating frenchman gilles simon while in the first match of the day sixth seed feliciano lopez defeated ivo karlovic there were also wins for slovakias karol beck and croatian duo ivan ljubicic and mario ancic big guns ease through in san jose topseeded americans andy roddick and andre agassi survived minor scares to reach the last eight of the sap open agassi endured early problems against lefthanded dane kenneth carlsen before sealing a victory and world number three roddick dropped a set to korean player hyungtaik lee before pulling out a win in san jose california seventh seed jurgen melzer came through against xavier malisse winner in delray beach last week frenchman cyril saulnier meanwhile fired aces to secure a win over czech qualifier tomas zib roddick broke a racket in frustration in the third game of the second set and afterwards was unimpressed with his form im not playing great he said but im through and im going to keep battling a lot of people are under the assumption that its easy to play well every week and its not it is the th time in appearances at the event that agassi now has progressed to the quarterfinal stage he came from down in the opening game to hold serve and gradually wore carlsen down after attacking his backhand agassi also employed several lobs and charged to the net to unsettle the yearold dane ranked th in the world as the match went on i got real patient and waited for my opportunities and felt pretty good said agassi melzer shocks agassi in san jose second seed andre agassi suffered a comprehensive defeat by jurgen melzer in the quarterfinals of the sap open agassi was often bamboozled by the austrians drop shots in san jose losing defending champion and top seed andy roddick rallied to beat swedens thomas enqvist but unseeded cyril saulnier beat the fourth seed vincent spadea and tommy haas overcame eighth seed max mirnyi melzer has now beaten agassi in two of their three meetings i had a good game plan and i executed it perfectly he said its always tough to come out to play andre i didnt want him to play his game he makes you run like a dog all over the court and agassi who was more than matched for power by his opponents twohanded backhand said melzer was an example of several players on the tour willing to take their chances against him a lot more guys are capable of it now said the american he played much better than me thats what he did both times i had opportunities to loosen myself up agassi added but i didnt convert on the big points
